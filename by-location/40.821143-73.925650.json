Note, under construction, on the block bounded by East 159th and 158th Streets, the large 6-story Thomas Garden Apartments, and south of it, the rectangular Fleischmann Company laboratory. The wooded park area from East 161st to 158th Streets is now (1938) occupied by the New Bronx County Court House. Also shown is a panoramic view southward with the Hell Gate Bridge across the East River visible in the distant left background, and Manhattan discernible in the right background.
