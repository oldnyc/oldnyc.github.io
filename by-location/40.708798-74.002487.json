Armbruster Collection.\n\nNo. 11, the 2\u00bd-story building with a white stucco front is reputed to have been standing in 1725, on land, then owned by Johans Hardenbrooke. Adjoining same, is a 4-story tenement, No. 9, at one time the home of former Governor Alfred E. Smith. The 3-story frame structure, number 7, north of the latter, was the home of Dr. Valentine, of Valentine's Manual fame. It is now the junk shop of Frank Carson. According to the New York Sun of October 2, 1937, these buildings may be demolished. See same for further data.\n",
