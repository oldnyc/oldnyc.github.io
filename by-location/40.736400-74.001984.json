The old Continental Brewery, which stood on the S.W. corner of Greenwich Avenue and 11th Street, directly in the way of the subway, was demolished, and later the little one-story building, for shops, was erected to fill in the space along the new Seventh Avenue South. This picture was taken the year Prohibition was repealed; the following year the 11th Street shops shown here were taken over by a liquor store.\n\nMay 20, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.",
