    "text": "Eighth Street, Astor Place and Lafayette Place showing the old building of the Mercantile Library, or Clinton Hall, erected at the junction of those Avenues. The Library was founded on November 9, 1820, by clerks of merchants. In 1821 it was located in one room at #49 Fulton Street, with 150 members and 700 volumes. From this time it grew rapidly and in 1830 a Clinton Hall Association was formed for the purpose of erecting. In 1854 the Association purchased the Astor Place Opera House, remodeled it for a Library as shown in picture, later this was replaced, in 1891 by the present building,with capacity for 475,000 volumes.\n\nRef: King's Handbook of New York.

The corner building mentioned (extreme right) bears No. 38 4th Avenue in the Perris, New York Insurance Map of 1854. Adjoining same is St. Ann's R. C. Church, with No's. 145, 143 and 141, progressing westward to Broadway. Across the background appears the new A. T. Stewart Building, which today (1937) is the north unit of Wanamaker's. The south unit being raised on the area occupied as shown in this view, exclusive of No. 38 4th Avenue and adjacent. In 1879, a Jacob Aberle converted the church building into a variety theatre, known as the 8th Street Theatre. About 1890, performances were given in Hebrew by native actors. It was called the Germania and German Theatre in 1897 and 1902 respectively. About 1905 it formed a portion of the present site of the aforementioned department store.\n\nPrior to 1879.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",
