The one at the left was remodelled when it was moved to its present site. View No. 3 shows the old parsonage now located at the S.E. corner of Fifty-third Avenue and Seabury Street. Eugene L. Armbruster states the old parsonage was built either in 1820 or 1821. He also believes that the small building in the foreground of view No. 2 is the old school house. He states also that the Rev. Geo. Whitefield preached in 1764 in an orchard which covered the site of the parsonage.\n\nView 2: July 1925\nView 2: June 1923\nView 3: July 1925.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
