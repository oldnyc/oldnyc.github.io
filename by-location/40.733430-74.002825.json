This part of 4th Street is an old Village street, shown on an 1803 map as Chester Street and on the 1811 city survey (when the numbered streets and avenues were first planned) as William Street. Before long, however, the true 4th Street on the East Side was extended to this point, and that number was applied to this street all the way to its terminus at 13th and\nGansevoort Streets, west of Eighth Avenue.\nThe block on the east side of 4th Street, from Christopher to 10th (formerly Amos) Streets, was broken up when Seventh Avenue South was cut through around 1914. All that was left west of Seventh Avenue South were Nos. 229-31 West 4th Street, shown in this picture with the Sinclair Motor 0il advertisement on the side of 229. The building shown in part on the left is the new one built in 1931 on the site of the Greenwich Village Theatre, which itself was built on the old N.W. corner of 4th and Christopher Streets after Seventh\nAvenue South was cut through.\n233 West 4th Street, on the N.E. corner of 10th Street, is a fairly\nnew apartment house.\nMarch 25, 1933.\nP.
