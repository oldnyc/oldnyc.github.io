It is one of the oldest landmarks of the region and stood on what was formerly Seventh Ave., between Third and Fourth Streets in the village of Olinville, town of Westchester, Westchester County. The G.W. Bromley map of 1913 shows the house no longer to be there and the 1927 map shows its site occupied by two 2-story brick houses, in the very center of the block on lots 26 and 29.\n1906.\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
