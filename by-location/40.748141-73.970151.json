On the opposite side of the thoroughfare is the New York Edison Company power hose. From this view building the United Parcel Service will distribute the majority of purchases made in local department stores, supplanting similar individual functions. It was this structure that necessitated various changes in plans for the 38th Street East River Tunnel and which finally emerged to the south of same.\n\nOctober 26, 1928.\nP.L. Sperr\n",
