    "text": "14th Street, south side, west from St. Bernard's Church (330 West 14th Street) to Hudson Street and Ninth Avenue, inclusive. St. Bernard's Roman Catholic Church, the first New York church to be dedicated by an American cardinal, was built in the face of the economic depression of the 1870's by the new parish laid out in 1868 by Cardianl McCloskey. The cornerstone was laid in May, 1873, and the church dedicated May 31, 1875.  A contemporty drawing of it shows a conical spire surmounting each tower, either these were never completed, or they were later taken off.\nThe six-story building at 342 West 14th Street was erected between 1885 and 1891, replacing an old brick hous.\n\nMarch 31, 1930\n\nP.L.
