This photograph was taken by one such Englishman, and was annotated in his own writing \"Where I stayed with\nLucas C. E. en route from Venezuela to England\".\nAbout 1906 this building will be replaced by the 12-story Brunswick Building, as Madison Square changes into a strictly business district.\n1888.\n",

This picture gives a good view of Madison Square Garden (1889-1925), and the lovely Diana of St. Gaudens, poised atop its tower. The Garden was acquired by the New York Life Insurance Company in 1915 at a foreclosure sale, and in 1920 was saved from demolition by Tex Rickard, who signed a ten year lease on it. In 1924 the New York LLife bought back this 1ease and in 1925 tore down the Garden,to build their present edifice on its site. Diana, however, is still to be seen in Fairmont\nTark, Philadelphia.\nIn the centre, with the Uneeda Biscuit sign on its roof, is the Hotel Brunswick, and at the extreme left is the Hotel Victoria, made famous by the patronage of President Cleveland. To the right of the Garden is the former Jerome residence, later the University\nClub and now (1935) the Manhattan Club.\nAbout 1898.\nBrowning Studios.\n",
