Number one shows beyond the swamp the Corona Dumps viewed east from about 111th Street and Fifty-second Avenue; number two is also looking eastward and shows Fifty-third Avenue in the foreground. This avenue, no longer designated as such, is now the entrance to the World's Fair Site; number Three is taken viewing east from 111th Street and Fifty-fifth Avenue and shows another portion of the dumps; number four is taken in the same direction, on the same street at Fifty-sixth Avenue and shows the dump being levelled. In the background (telegraph poles thereon) is 114th Street extending north and south. Just beyond it had been laid the Grand Central Parkway.\n\nMay 1923\nViews 1,2, 3 and 4\n\nEugene L.
