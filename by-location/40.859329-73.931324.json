(foreground and partially hidden by the shrubbery) photographed in a northwestward direction from Fort George towards the Dyckman Street gap. This thoroughfare separates Fort Washington (now 1938, Fort Tryon Park) and Inwood Hill (now a City park also). In the northern extremity of the former and where the small cleared area appears, stands the recently constructed Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the extreme right is the vague outline of Marble Hill on the far side of the Harlem River.\n\nOctober 26, 1927.\nViews 1 and 2\n\nP.L. Sperr\n",

    "text": "Broadway (across midground of panoramic views) from Nagle Avenue (left foreground and across view to the right) observed in a northwestward direction from a vantage given by the photographer as near Fairview Avenue. The view is towards the Dyckman Street gap, from the Fort George area. To the left stood the Revolutionary Fort Washington, overlooking the North (Hudson) River. This site is shown occupied by the castle-like mansion of Dr. Chas. V. Paterno, the Geo. Barnard Grey studio and the C.K.G. Billings manor. Today (1938) the 1st is being demolished for a new apartment site; the 2nd has been replaced by similar buildings and the 3rd was razed and the area included in Fort Tryon Park. To the right on the north side of the gap rises Inwood Hill. This today is also a City park. At the far side of the latter the Harlem River flows into the Hudson.\n\nOctober 26, 1927.\nViews 1 and 2\n\nP.L. Sperr\n",
