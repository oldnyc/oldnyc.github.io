The house does not have a water supply and drinking water is obtained from a pump in the yard. As the dwelling is situated near the Downey Shipbuilding Corporation yard, and is one of a number of similar ones, it is very likely that it is inhabited by the shipyard workers and their families.\n\nAbout 1910\n\nCommittee on Housing\nCharity Organization Society\n",
