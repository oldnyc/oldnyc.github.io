The Library was founded on November 9, 1820, by clerks of merchants. In 1821 it was located in one room at #49 Fulton Street, with 150 members and 700 volumes. From this time it grew rapidly and in 1830 a Clinton Hall Association was formed for the purpose of erecting. In 1854 the Association purchased the Astor Place Opera House, remodeled it for a Library as shown in picture, later this was replaced, in 1891 by the present building,with capacity for 475,000 volumes.\n\nRef: King's Handbook of New York.

The south unit being raised on the area occupied as shown in this view, exclusive of No. 38 4th Avenue and adjacent. In 1879, a Jacob Aberle converted the church building into a variety theatre, known as the 8th Street Theatre. About 1890, performances were given in Hebrew by native actors. It was called the Germania and German Theatre in 1897 and 1902 respectively. About 1905 it formed a portion of the present site of the aforementioned department store.\n\nPrior to 1879.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",

A new building will be erected here in 1891 for their purpose. The library was founded November 9, 1820, by clerks of merchants. In 1821, in one room at 49 Fulton Street, it had 150 members and 700 volumes. In 1826, in the building of Harper & Bros. in Cliff Street, it had 6000 books. In 1828 the merchants made enthusiastic by the achievements of the clerks, organized the Clinton Hall Association for the purpose of giving a building to the library. This association, in 1830, erected the first Clinton Hall on the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets. The building herewith shown is the second Clinton Hall.
