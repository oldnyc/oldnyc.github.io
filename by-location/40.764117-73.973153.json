Roosevelt's administration, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was passed by Congress and signed by the President. This act delegated to the President the right to draft codes for industries, which established, among other things, minimum wages and maximum hours. Under the provisions of this act, President Roosevelt created the National Recovery Administration (NRA), with General Hugh S. Johnson as Administrator. Industries were invited to draft their own codes and submit them to General Johnson and his staff for approval. Pending the adoption of these codes, all businesses, big and small, were invited to subscribe to a blanket code draft by Roosevelt, and known as the NRA (President's Recovery Agreement). All those who did so received a token of compliance to poster bearing the Blue Eagle clothing in the foot of the cog-wheels of industry, and in the other streaks of lightning. During its early days, NRA was greeted with almost fanatical, not to say hysterical, support by both business and labor. Only from the communists and a few other minor radicals did it receive bitter denunciation. In New York City this enthusiasm expressed itself in the form of a monster parade, surpassing in size the other parades. It formed at Washington Square, and marched north on Fifth Avenue to 60th Street, where it disbanded. The first group of marchers left Washington Square around two o'clock in the afternoon and reached midnight before the last marchers reached 66th Street and the parade disbanded. The picture gives a glimpse of the individual portions of the parade; but it is impossible to get any idea of its size or the enthusiasm of the participants. Anyone who has interest in the history of NRA will find it a most interesting chapter. Within six months the popularity of NRA began to wane. An attempt was made to revive the NRA enthusiasm and the slogan 'Buy under the Blue Eagle' was used, but it was unsuccessful. In the Schechter case, the Supreme Court declared the NRA codes unconstitutional. The NRA was popularily known as 'Roosevelt's New Deal.' The NRA still exists, but without the codes it has little meaning. All Blue Eagles have been repealed, and it is a penal offense to display one. The codes have been held to be violations of the minimum wages, maximum hours, and fair practice clauses. September 13, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n\nNo. 2, NRA Parade.

    "text": "A Set of Seven Canvases of Old New York.\n\nThese paintings come from a country house called 'Glencairn' near Dublin in Ireland, where they adorned the walls of the billiard room. The house was built by Richard 'Boss' Croker (1841-1922), an Irishman who for many years was associated with Tammany Hall in New York, holding political positions under William M. 'Boss' Tweed, and later, after the latter's ousting, under 'Honest John' Kelly. Following the Lexow Committee investigations (1889-90), he left for England where he took up residence in Wantage, Berks., returning to America periodically, attempting to regain his lost position in the Democratic Party. After his final defeat in 1900, he crossed the Atlantic once again, built 'Glencairn' and started a racing stable. Despite his past reputation (he paid, in all, $550,000 for his Irish estates), he lived up to the high standards demanded by British racing circles, and when his horse Orby won the Derby in 1907, did not even back him.\n\nThese pictures were painted to remind him of New York, and it is assumed that they were executed here around the turn of the century. All are painted in tones of sepia and green.\n\nThe British Government has recently acquired this mansion for the use of the British Ambassador to Ireland.\n\nPARK-BERNET\nSale 2234, Nov. 2930, 1963\n365.
