    "text": "Monroe Place, at the S.E. corner of Clark Street, showing The Church Of The New Jerusalem purchased in 1868, by the Brooklyn Society of The New Church (Swedenborgian), which was organized on June 15, 1859, from the congregation of The Church Of Our Father, a Universalist Society, founded in October 1842, who held their first services in a hall at the corner of Fulton and Cranberry Streets. The society later erected a new building at the corner of Pineapple and Fulton Streets. In 1848, the latter building was destroyed by fire, and the structure in this view was erected; and named \"The Church Of Our Father\". The congregation of this church with that of \"The Church Of The Redeemer\" - a group(dissenters) - again combined in 1868 and moved to the corner of Grand Ave., and Leffert's Place in 1883.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L.
