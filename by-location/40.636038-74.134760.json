    "text": "Richmond Avenue, at the N.E. corner of Castleton Avenue, showing Progress Hall, also known as the Jaques House, and the Harrison House. Dr. John T. Harrison lived here in 1853. Cornelius Mersereau was born in this house. It is stated, too, that Commodore Vanderbilt was born here. The residence was built by Isaac Jaques. Above the door there is the number 125. That was the house number before Castleton Avenue was cut through from Richmond to Heberton Avenues. The house no longer appears in Bromley's 1917 real estate map. See Legends, Stories and Folklore of Old Staten Island by Gilbert & Davis, part I, p. 106.\nAbout 1900\nBy Eugene G. Putnam\nFrom Staten Island Museum Collection through P. L. Sperr\n",
