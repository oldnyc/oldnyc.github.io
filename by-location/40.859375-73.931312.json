In the northern extremity of the former and where the small cleared area appears, stands the recently constructed Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The view is towards the Dyckman Street gap, from the Fort George area. To the left stood the Revolutionary Fort Washington, overlooking the North (Hudson) River. This site is shown occupied by the castlelike mansion of Dr. Chas. V. Paterno, the Geo. Barnard Grey studio and the C.K.G. Billings manor. Today (1938) the 1st is being demolished for a new apartment site; the 2nd has been replaced by simular buildings and the 3rd was razed and the area included in Fort Tryon Park. To the right on the north side of the gap rises Inwood Hill. This today is also a City park.
