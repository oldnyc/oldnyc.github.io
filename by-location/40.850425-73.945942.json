Right, construction work on one of the piers of the great Hudson River Bridge which will be opened in 1932 at a cost of about 170 million.

The distance between the two piers, from which the Bridge will be suspended, is 3,500 feet -- over twice the length of the longest suspension bridge at present\n(Camden-Philadelphia span).\nn.d.
