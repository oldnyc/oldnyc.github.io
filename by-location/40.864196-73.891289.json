    "text": "This house is 355 East 194th Street, between Marion Avenue and Decatur Avenue in the Bronx, NY.\n\nI grew up in that house. It had 17 private garages in the back and two massive gardens, one including a peach tree that bore fruit.\n\nThe house was a 3 family house, with a full basement, attic, and a dumbwaiter.  The home had one fireplace, with a marble mantel.\n\nI believe the home was leveled in 2012 or so to build a home for the Veterans Administration.\n\nCamille DeSantis",
