It had 17 private garages in the back and two massive gardens, one including a peach tree that bore fruit.\n\nThe house was a 3 family house, with a full basement, attic, and a dumbwaiter.  The home had one fireplace, with a marble mantel.\n\nI believe the home was leveled in 2012 or so to build a home for the Veterans Administration.\n\nCamille DeSantis",
