    "text": "(1)\nHaven Avenue, east side, from 173rd to 176th Streets. The house in the foreground is the old farmhouse of A. F. Smith, who had a six and one-half acre farm here. The main body of the house probably does not antedate 1870, although it was preceded by an earlier structure on the same site. The little brick wing on the south was added between 1902 and 1910. The little house farther along on the avenue is the modernized house standing on the old Howland farm, which adjoined the Smith farm on the north. The apartment houses beyond, on the S.E. corner of 176th Street, were built around 1924. Around 1910, Haven Avenue used to be known as Buena Vista Avenue.\nMay 27, 1927.\nP. L. Sperr.\n(2)\nThe same, more than seven years later. The two old houses have been demolished; and the land is being cleared and made over\ninto a park to be called J. Hood Wright Park.\nOctober 30, 1934.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
