Upon this site formerly stood Irving Hall, opened December 20, 1860 for balls, lectures and concerts, and which was famous as a rendezvous for one faction of the Democratic party, to which it gave its name. Today (1938), this building is given over to Burlesque performances, a feature which aroused local interest when Judge Crain was District Attorney of Manhattan recently; this and adjoining property being in his family for years. A negative print accompanies this, forming a set of two.\nAbout 1900.\nNeg# 1748\n",
