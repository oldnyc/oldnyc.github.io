The gas tanks are in the two blocks 6lst to 62nd and 62nd to 63rd Streets; opposite the second one, on the N.E. corner of 62nd Street, is the pumping station and tower of the Consolidated Gas Company. Behind and to the right of these may be seen the melting plant of George Ehret, east of York Avenue between 63rd and 64th Streets; it will be demolished in October 1930. Demolition of buildings on the east side of the Avenue, from 68th to 71st Streets, has not yet taken place.\nAt the time of this picture the name of the Avenue, north from this point, is about to be changed to York Avenue. The old Avenue A house numbers will still be used after the change.\n\nMarch 5, 1928.\nNew York Edison Company Collection.\n\nHandwritten: NEG # 3075\n",
