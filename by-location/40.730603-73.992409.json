    "text": "Central Park: Southwestern entrance (originally called Merchant's Gate), at Columbus Circle, with the ball ground and Green in the center background. The monument at the entrance of the Park was erected to commemorate the sailors who were lost when the battleship Maine was blown up -- the incident which led to the Spanish-American War. The Columbus statue, by Russo, stands on the tall pedestal in the middle of the Circle, in the left foreground. Along the horizon may be seen the buildings on Fifth Avenue and the East Side.\n\nAbout 1922.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",
