In the center of the view, among the trees, appears the Watson Mansion, a sumptuous stone edifice. The view shows the land being leveled out for the laying out of thoroughfares and for future real estate development. Several apartment houses and store buildings were later erected on this section of the avenue. The road on the extreme left of the view is the former Watson's Lane, which led past the mansion and up toward West Farms Road. It is now (1939) Wheeler Avenue.\n\nAbout 1910\n",
