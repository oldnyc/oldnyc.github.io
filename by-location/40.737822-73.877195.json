Views one and two show at the right the former St. James Episcopal Church, now used as a chapel. The houses seen in these two views were the property of S. Manwaring in 1873. View number two also shows adjoining and next to the Exempt Firemen's Association Home, at the left, the old and new quarters of the Newtown Register. This old one story structure was the first school erected in the village. It was built in 1740 and consisted of one room. It was used as a school until 1870. White purchased the building in 1873 when he founded the Register. Of all the buildings seen in the four views only the chapel remained in October 1930, and the building adjoining it. In view number four center right, is the building housing the Buckley Butcher Shop. The Exempt Firemen's Building was formerly a one story structure which was enlarged some time subsequent to 1843 when the Wandewenock Company was organized.\n\nView 3:\n\nEugene L.
