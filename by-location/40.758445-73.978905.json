The individuals congregating on the sidewalk are mechanics seeking work. View 3 is eastward from the 50th Street \"El\" platform of the Sixth Avenue Line. Detailed is the excavation for the R. C. A. Bldg. On the Fifth Avenue side will rise the British and the Franck Bldgs. Beyond the steel work for the latter is Saks-Fifth Avenue. The twin spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the old R. C. A.
