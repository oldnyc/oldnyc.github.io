These grounds were sold to a group of prominent Brooklyn residents, who formed the Brooklyn Jockey Club, which enlarged this tract to 460 acres at a cost of $400,000. It was opened in 1887. This view shows a straightaway and \"Grand Stand\" - To-day (1929) Stryker Street runs through the front of and along the site of the stand. The new tract was bounded on the north by Ave. Q, on the east by Ocean Parkway, on the west by Mc Donald Ave., and East 2nd Street, and on the south by Ave. V and Johnson Lane. The Dwyer brothers and the prominent Brooklynites incorporated under the name of the Brooklyn Jockey Club Track of Gravesend, Inc. The last meet was held in 1910. In 1922, the grounds were sold for $750,000 to William E. Harriman, and this section became known as the King's Club district.\n?\nEugene L.
