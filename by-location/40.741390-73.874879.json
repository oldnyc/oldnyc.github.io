Armbruster states that one Van Rieper states the fully seen house as that of Mrs. Riker. However a map compiled by J. Riker Junior in 1852 shows a house adjoining the African Church but gives no owner. In 1873, one Braddish was an occupant but no owner is listed in 1909 or 1915.\n\n1922\n\nEugene L.
