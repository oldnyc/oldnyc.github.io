No. 7, the mate to No. 9, was demolished about 1930 when the No. 1 Bank Street apartment house was built.\n\nBank Street owes its name to the Yellow Fever plague of 1796, which drove New Yorkers out to the healthier air of Greenwich Village. The banks settled in the block at the right, bounded by Bank Street, Greenwich Avenue, Hammond Street (now 11th Street) and Mary Street (now upper Waverly Place).\nMarch 29, 1933.\n\nP.L.
