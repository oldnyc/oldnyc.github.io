George Trapp Jr. from 1884 to 1896 manufactured carriages in this building. Eugene L. Armbruster states that the buildings were demolished in October 1930, except for a small part at the north end which is Cupid Williams[sic] house. However the 1926 Atlas shows brick buildings on the site.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection",
