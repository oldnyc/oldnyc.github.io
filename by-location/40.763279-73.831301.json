    "text": "Northern Boulevard (foreground), at the N.W. corner of Farrington Street, showing the George Bridges livery stables in 1873. J. Underhill was the owner of the building.  George Trapp Jr. from 1884 to 1896 manufactured carriages in this building. Eugene L. Armbruster states that the buildings were demolished in October 1930, except for a small part at the north end which is Cupid Williams[sic] house. However the 1926 Atlas shows brick buildings on the site.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
