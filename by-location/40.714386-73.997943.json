Note entrance to the Chinese Theatre, at Nos. 5-7 on the left of view. Buildings on the right (Nos. 6, 8, and 10), are 3-story frame houses.\nAbout 1890.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n\nIn the older view, note at No. 8, the Chatham Club; the cabaret where Irving Berlin, the famous songwriter first started. Facing same is the old Chinese Theatre, that has now become the Chinatown Mission. This, in conjunction with the Arcade (wooden structure at the head of the bend) played a major role in the intermeicine strife that habitually flares up in this locality and thereby caused this turn to be known as the Bloody Angle. No. 3 has been stated as the site of the home of Anthony H. Doyer in 1809, the individual whose name is perpetuated here. Around the bend on the right, Scotchy Lavelle maintained a dive at No. 14. Occupying the Bowery corners were similar enterprises, Barney Flynn's and Callahan's.\n",
