Prior to 1806 this was a waste area, and in olden times a burial place for the poor. It was the site of a U.S. Arsenal, between 1806 to 1823. The first House of Refuge was founded here in 1825, which burned down in 1839. During the Mayoralty of James Harper (one of the famous publishers); between 1844 and 1847; this dreary region was cleared and beautified, and became the famous Madison Square. To-day this park is surrounded by large buildings, of which the Madison Ave. contingent predominates; possessing, as it does the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Buildings and Tower; the Madison Ave. Building; the Appellate division Supreme Court; the Manhattan Club and the New York Life Insurance Co. Building. The William H. Seward Statue shown in the foreground, (N.E. corner of Fifth Ave. and East 23rd Street), was unveiled in 1876, and is inscribed: Governor, U.S. Senator, Secretary of State U.S.\n\n1936.\n\nW.P.A.
