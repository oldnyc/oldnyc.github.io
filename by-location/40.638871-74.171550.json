    "text": "60 Holland Avenue, west side, at Bailey Place (south of Richmond Terrace), showing the kitchen of the first story rear apartment of a two-story frame dwelling. This is, in all probability, the home of one of the underpaid workmen of the Downey Shipbuilding Corporation, whose shipyards are located in the back of the house. Conditions such as this can be found all along Holland Avenue, which is inhabited mainly by the shipyard hands.\n\nAbout 1910\n\nCommittee on Housing\nCharity Organization Society\n",
