On the left are several six story apartment houses, that formerly bore No's. 1-3, 5-7 and 9-13 Hancock Street. These will remain, acquiring 6th Avenue identities. On the extreme right is the rear of the Downing Street site, upon which in 1941 will rise a modern apartment structure, No. 10 Downing Street. The new west line of the Avenue will run there, forming the easterly side of this building plot. The partially demolished 6-story structures shown there front on West Houston Street. They will remain. Through the center is Congress Street, a short thoroughfare extending south of West Houston to King Street. This is to be included in the new thoroughfare.\n\nP. L.
