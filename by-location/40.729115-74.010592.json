Hammersley Street was one of the group of parallel east-west streets laid out in the Trinity Church Farm, and hmet the western end of the original Houston Street just east across the line between the Trinity Farm and the West Bayard Farm, at the\naouthern end of Bedford Street (1.v.).\nIn 1858 this street lost its own name and was absorbed by Houston Street. At that time, and thereafter till the redistricting of 1917, it served as the southern boundary of the Ninth Ward, which was\nroughly identical with Greenwich Village.\nIn 1930 these buildings at and east of West Street will be demolished for the site of the new St. John's Park Freight Terminal (see West Street). Houston Street, from West to Washington Streets, will be permanently closed and incorporated with the site of the\nfreight station.\nMarch 6, 1929.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
