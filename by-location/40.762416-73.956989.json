    "text": "York Avenue, east side, from 67th to 65th Streets, showing buildings of the Rockefeller Foundation for Medical Research. On the north (left) is Laboratory No. 2 (1916), and joined onto it part of the original 2-story Animal House (1906) with a later enlargement. Another laboratory will be built north of these buildings, in 1930. The building in the center is the original laboratory, dedicated May 11, 1906; between that and the Main Hospital (about 1910) the 2-story Isolation Building is barely visible. The chimney in the right background is part of the new Power House built late in 1915. September 17, 1927.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
