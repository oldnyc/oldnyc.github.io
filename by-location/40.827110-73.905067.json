    "text": "13 . PUDDING ROCK, formerly on Boston Road and 166th Street. A truly immense glacial bowlder, rising 25 feet in the air, and being 30 feet-in diameter. On one side was a natural fire-place, where the Indians used to enjoy their corn feasts and oyster banquets. Under its cool shade, the Huguenots rested on their long Sabbath Day journeys from New Rochelle down to the old French Protestant Church in lower New York. After serving as a natural landmark to early settlers and to travelers in stage coaches enroute from New York to Boston, it has finally been blasted into countless fragments so as no longer to \"obstruct the march of civilization.\"\n\nNeg. #1742",
