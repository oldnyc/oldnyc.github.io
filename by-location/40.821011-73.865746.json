In the center is the old Dominick Lynch Mansion, a stone structure. In this house was celebrated the first mass in Westchester County and the committee to design the American flag met here before proceeding to Philadelphia. The land in this area was owned by Lynch in 1793, part of which was sold, in the same year, to Issac Classon, whence the name is derived. In 1870 the mansion was bought by the Christian Brothers of the Catholic Faith, who changed it into the Sacred Heart Academy in 1883. It later became part of the Clason Point Military Academy.\n\nJune, 1926\n\nBrown Brothers\n",
