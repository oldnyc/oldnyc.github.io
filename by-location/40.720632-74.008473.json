This structure, erected 1868 by the Hudson River Railroad (chartered 1846 and consolidated into the New York Central and Hudson Railroad in 1869), occupies the land that was formerly St. Johns Park. Facing St. Johns Chapel on Varick Street, it provided a picturesque setting. The spire of the Chapel appears at the top.\n\nAbout 1890\n\nEwing Galloway\n",
