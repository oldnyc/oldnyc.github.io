Occupying the S.E. and N.E. corners of East 21st Street respectively are the New Amsterdam Hotel and Calvary P.E. Church. The Unitarian Church at which George P. Baker, Joseph Choate, William Cullen Bryant and Peter Cooper were worshipers, was demolished in 1929 and the property sold for a Club hotel which never materialized and the site vacant since. The congregation meanwhile moved into a newly constructed edifice at Lexington Ave. and East 80th Street. According to the New York Times of March 26, 1938 a new 6-story apartment house will shortly rise here at a cost of $600,000.\n\n1906.\nBrown Brothers.\n\nNeg #3222.",
