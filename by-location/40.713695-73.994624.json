    "text": "68 East Broadway, adjoining the S.W. corner of Market Street, showing two views of Botanic Hall where Continental Lodge No. 287, F and A.M., New York City was constituted on April 22, 1853. They remained in this Masonic Temple for two years; the Lodge room being on the upper floor according to Dr. Frank Law of Flushing, Long Island, the last descendant of his line. At this time Doric Lodge No. 280 and Independent Lodge No. 185 met here also, this being a well known center of Masonic activities. Botanic Hall was on the second floor, the store being occupied by Law and Boyd, Botanical Pharmacists, who later bought the building. The original picture was taken from a yellowed billhead of this firm showing an old wood cut engraving of this structure as it appeared when Metropolitan Medical College was an occupant. Percy Boyd Plumb, the last descendant of the Boyds and who continued the business until 1916 supplied this, and is the authority for the statement that Abraham Lincoln spoke here on the occasion of his memorable visit to New York when he spoke at Cooper Union. Trows City Directory first lists the College at this address in the 1857 edition. Note the lantern hanging over the stairway door at the left, with the square and compasses which were lighted on Lodge nights. In the rear, above the fifth floor there is a two room apartment that is believed to still remain. Francis J. Arkins, Past Master and Historian of Continental Lodge No. 287 and Secretary of the Masonic Board of Relief of New York City unearthed this after a five year search, completing the collection of the total number of Masonic Temples in which Continental Lodge has met since 1853. An air brushed view removing the College signs accompanies this and shows this building as it originally appeared.\n\nAbout 1860.\n\nGift of Francis J. Arkins.\n",
