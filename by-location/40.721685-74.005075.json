    "text": "Canal Street (foreground), from Laight (left), to Vestry (right) Streets, as viewed southwestward from Thompson Street. To the left and across a cleared square where the former St. Johns Park depot of the New York City Railroad stood, appear loft structures on the west side of Hudson Street; prominent of which is the 14 story Green Industrial Building at the S.W. corner of Hubert Street. The Ballantine sign is on the easterly side of the storage warehouses extending thru Laight to Vestry Streets and form a new west side for this block (demolition for Holland Tunnel exit which is at the extreme right). The white structure at the latter point is the Green Terminal Building, at the N.E. corner of Hudson and Vestry Streets.\n\nP.L. Sperr\n\nMarch 11, 1938.\n",
