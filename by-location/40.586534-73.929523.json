It will be eventually in the neighborhood of Plumb 2nd Street and Harkness Ave. These views are general, and show in the background the Rockaways, and the new Marine Parkway Bridge which connects Brooklyn with the Rockaways, across Jamaica Bay. Most of this view of the foreground will be a part of Marine Park. This series of three views were taken at slightly different angles. The piles in the foreground were once a part of a walk to the Gerritsen Beach ferry. June 18, 1937.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
