    "text": "Lexington Avenue, west side, at 46th Street, looking southwest from 47th Street, showing the new Grand Central yards under construction. Practically everything from Lexington to Madison Avenues has been torn up in the process.\n\nThe Tiffany Studios, on the S.E. corner of Madison Avenue and 45th Street, occupy the old building of the Manhattan Athletic Club. In 1917 that building will be replaced by a branch of the Equitable Trust Company. To its left may be seen the Hotel Manhattan (about 1898) at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street, and farther to the left a tower and part of the old Grand Central Station along Vanderbilt Avenue. The Hotel Belmont (1906), at the S.W. corner of Park Avenue, stands out pretty conspicuously behind the new Post Office, on the west side of Lexington Avenue from 45th to 44th Streets. The latter, in the left foreground, is connected by a bridge to the new Grand Central Terminal, which is under construction on the east side. Of the old Terminal the offices along Vanderbilt Avenue remain.\n\nJuly, 1909\n\nEwing Galloway.",
