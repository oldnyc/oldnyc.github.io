For a brief period between 1910 and 1915 they were known as the Hotel Wallick. The land upon which they stand has been owned by the Goelet interests, passing from Ogden Goelet to his daughter May, the wife of the Duke of Roxburghe, and to her son the present Duke.\nFor a more complete account see the New York Times of March 19, 1940.\n\nGeorge L.
