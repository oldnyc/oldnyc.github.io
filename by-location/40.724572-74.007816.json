No 570 is the Roman Catholic Church of our Lady of Vilna. No 574 is the Duane Methodist Episcopal Church, which settled down at this address late in 1929. The old church (about 1862), at 292 Hudson Street, on the east side, south of Spring Street was demolished in 1923 (see Hudson Street). Originally the church was on Duane Street, where it was established in 1797 and stood till destroyed by fire in 1861.\nSeptember 27, 1927",
