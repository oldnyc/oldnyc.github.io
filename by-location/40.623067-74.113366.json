Now another family is reuniting in this grand temple-fronted house, as a new addition brings together three generations under one roof.\n\nNow on a small plot surrounded by modest houses, the Gardiner-Tyler house was built around 1837 as a much larger country estate, apparently by an Eliza Racey, about whom little is known.",
