    "text": "Hegeman Ave., south side, east from Hopkins to Rockaway Aves., showing the B.M.T. car depot. E.L. Armbruster states a white house occupied by Anna Leinfelder stood on the corner which is now the site of the carbarns. He also states the Adams' Bone factory was directly opposite. New Lots Road, Mill Road, and Canarsie Road converged in the foreground (where trolley tracks curve toward the fence). However the Brooklyn Real Estate Atlas of 1890 by E. Robinson shows the Leinfelder house to be on the S.E. corner of Bristol Street and New Lots Road (Hegeman Ave., in 1929), while the Adams Bone factory was at the S.E. corner of Rockaway Ave., and New Lots Road (Hegeman Ave.), that is opposite the car barns; and the Leinfelder home was at the right foreground where the tracks curve off Hegeman Ave.\n\nAugust 1923.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster.\n",
