It was built in the early 1700's and was partially destroyed by fire by the British in the Revolution. It was rebuilt and the family lived here until 1868 when it fell into disrepair. Presented to the City in 1915, it is now a museum.\nAbout 1920\nCopyright by\nUnderwood & Underwood\nGift of Urbrock Collaction\n",
