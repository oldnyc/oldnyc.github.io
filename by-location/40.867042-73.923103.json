    "text": "The Dyckman House, Broadway at the N.W. corner of 204th Street. This house was built early in the eighteenth century, and at the time of this photograph is not quite two hundred years old. The two wings are not a part of the original house, but were added during the 1860's. The house is falling into disrepair through long neglect, but it will soon be restored and converted into a museum, with the surrounding land a city park. The north wing will be demolished, but the south wing will stand as late as 1936, at which time it will be in use as a caretaker's residence.\n\n1895.\n\nGift of John H. Judd.\n",
