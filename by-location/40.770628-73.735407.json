This individual owned land just east of Little Neck Road and south to West End Drive. There is a large two story structure still on the premises which may be one of his old buildings. The 1909 atlas shows seven frame structures on his land, one of which is this house.\n\nIn 1928, Penbrooke Avenue was extended through the center of the property.\n\nAbout 1890.\nEugene L.
