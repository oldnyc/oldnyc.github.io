    "text": "Roosevelt Avenue, at the southwest corner of Queens Boulevard, showing a group of buildings demolished in 1925, because they stood directly in the center of the new Queens Boulevard line. J. Burroughs owned the large building in 1860, while the little house; one and one half story; may have been the house of J. Smith in that year. In 1873 J. W. Burroughs operated the Central Hotel in the house in the foreground; in 1874 it was Hownes Hotel. Hugh O'Reilly had it in 1922 when it was known as the Wayside Inn.\n\n1922\n\nEugene L.
