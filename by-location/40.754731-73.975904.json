To the right, between 46th and 47th Streets, is the new Grand Central Palace. The new building under construction at the N.E. corner of 49th Street is the new Railroad Y.M.C.A.; together with the power plant and the new Adams Express building it will stand until demolition in 1929. From 50th to 52nd Streets on the east side the old F. & M. Schaefer Brewery will give way between 1917 and 1919 to St. Bartholomew's Church and the Hotel Ambassador. The oldest part of the Brewery, including the tower at the S.E. corner of 51st Street, dates from the 1880's. Beyond the Brewery, the new 12-story Montana Apartments have been standing for about a year on the site of the old Steinway Factory. Above this point there is already quite a bit of apartment building.\n\nCompare this picture with Park Avenue from 45th Street in 1903 and in 1923-4, also with Park Avenue from 46th Street, Silver Jubilee Exposition in June 1923.\n\nNovember 25, 1913.",
