The plot (100 x 50 feet), was purchased from Horace A. Miller for $1400 and the Town Hall was opened on December 11, 1873.  The police station occupied the ground floor; the basement was used as a prison.  After 1886 it served solely as a station house.  On November 13, 1899 the present hospital was opened as the 26th Ward Homeopathic Hospital and Dispensary.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
