Burroughs owned the large building in 1860, while the little house; one and one half story; may have been the house of J. Smith in that year. In 1873 J. W. Burroughs operated the Central Hotel in the house in the foreground; in 1874 it was Hownes Hotel. Hugh O'Reilly had it in 1922 when it was known as the Wayside Inn.\n\n1922\n\nEugene L.
