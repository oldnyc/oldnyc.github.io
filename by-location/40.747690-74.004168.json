On the left, from Tenth to Ninth Avenues, is the original London Terrace, a row of cottages and apartment houses built in 1845 by Bishop Clement C. Moore, author of \"The Night before Christmas\". These houses were modelled on similar structures popular in London at the time, and for many years constituted a very fashionable address. They were demolished in 1929 and 1930, and replaced by a series of large, modern apartment houses which retain the name London Terrace.\n\nIn the right background may be seen the tower of the Metropolitan Life Building.\nJune, 1925.\n",
