Shown is a general view westward across the farmland of this section of Jackson Heights, before this area was developed into a residential neighborhood, with 2-story brick dwellings predominating. Trains Meadow Road and Old Bowery Road were the thoroughfares traversing this area. The former can be seen running across the face of the view from right to left, beginning where the white house is discernible (right). The vantage point is Old Bowery Road. April, 1923. Eugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n\n",
