This building appears in the center of this view, being the third structure from the left with fire escapes thereupon. Note that the roofing cornice has been removed. The tenements to this side of same are of the dumbbell type which originated in 1879 subsequent to the repeal in 1872 of the first tenement housing law of 1867.\n",
