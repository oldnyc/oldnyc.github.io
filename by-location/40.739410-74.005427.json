Gansevoort Street, originally the western end of Southampton Road, in Sir Peter Warren's farm, was later known as Great Kills Road. As it crossed the northern end of Greenwich Lane (Sady Hill Road), it was made part of Greenwich Lane (now Greenwich Avenue) early in the 19th Century. Later (in the 1830's) it was closed east of 13th Street at the upper end of Asylum Street (upper West 4th\nStreet), and named Gansevoort Street.\nThe nine-story building at West 4th Street is the Riker Hegeman\nBuilding.\nJuly 7, 1933.\nP.
