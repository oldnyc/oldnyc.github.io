This building replaced the former Brooklyn Theatre, which was destroyed by fire on December 5, 1876, and in which 300 people lost their lives, because of an inadvertent act on the part of the firemen in closing the doors before the building was emptied. Because of the furore resulting, when this building was erected it was considered the best in the United States from both a theatrical and safety standpoint. It was demolished in 1891, to make way for the new \"Brooklyn Eagle\" Building. In 1868, St. Johns Episcopal Church occupied the site.\n\n1882.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
