Then there is another little gap, followed by the double house 13-11 Vandam Street, which has a carriage entrance in the center of the house, under the round window, for carriages to go through to the back yard. Compare 48-50 King Street. No. 9 has two dormer windows. Beyond No. 7 is No. 5, a seven-story tenement house.\n\nAbout 1918.\n\nNew York Sun staff photograph.\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n",
