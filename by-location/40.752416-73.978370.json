On the right may be seen the old spur from the Third Avenue \"L\", to be taken down in 1924, and a glimpse of the little alley, between Grand Central Station and the Hotel Commodore, which used to be DePew Place, balancing Vanderbilt Avenue.\nTraffic is quite light over the viaduct, even if it is only 11:15 a.m. Both north and south bound traffic travels around the west shoulder of the station, between 42nd and 45th Streets; the viaduct to the east is yet a dead-end leg, for the convenience of the Commodore Hotel.  As yet no statue of Commodore Vanderbilt stands in front of the great central window, facing north bound automobile traffic.  Late 1922\nEwing Galloway\n",
