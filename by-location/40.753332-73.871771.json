Edward Leverich house and that Chas. P., his son, was born here in 1809. This information was given by one Van Rieper. However, the original home of Col. Edward Leverich was sold by him about 1820 to one Hendrickson, who in turn sold in 1851 to John and George Elliot. This house was located on the south side of Thirty-Seventh Ave. between 112th and 114th Street and was demolished prior to 1915.
