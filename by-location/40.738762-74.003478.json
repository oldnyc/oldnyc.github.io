The photographer is viewing towards Abingdon Square where the dominant 16-story apartment house appears. This bears No. 20 Abingdon Square and is at the S. E. corner of W. 12th Street.\n\nReturning to the foreground one observes the diagonal sweep of W. 4th Street across the Avenue, this is on right and running to the left center. This leaves a triangular block in the center, the apex of which touches upon Jane Street. The latter, though not seen, runs in a horizontal plane across the midground and is obstructed from view by the buildings at the right and left.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nApril 9, 1940\n",
