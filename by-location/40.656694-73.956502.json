Before its removal to the above location by Dr. Barlett in 1880, it had its appearance changed by the removal of the wings.  Its former location was Flatbush Ave. on the west, Bedford Ave. on the south. The building was razed in 1930 and a 4-story brick building was erected on the site. At its old location a group of one family houses were erected.\n1903.\nE. L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
