This is stated to be one of the oldest houses in Newtown, standing in part of town, now Long Island City, on Bowery Bay. This place was erected about 1650 by Harck Siboutsen and left by his son Jacobus to his nephew Abram Lent in 1729. From the Lent family it passed to the Rapelye family. Isaac Rapelye owned and occupied it prior to 1852. See Annals of Newtown by J. Riker for more data.\n? Date.\n\nArthur White.\n",
