Convergence in the foreground is that of West 211th and Isham Streets. Shown on the left and with a flag atop, is an old school at the S.E. corner of Broadway and Academy Street.

The 3-storied, square frame structure to the right of the latter is No. 54-56 Cooper Street, which still stood in 1927, though surrounded by apartment\nbuildings.\n\nAbout 1910.\n\nBrown Brothers.\n",
