    "text": "Broadway (right), southwest from West 212th Street, showing a westward view to the Jersey Palisades, as seen through the Dyckman Street gap, between what is now Tryon (left) and Inwood (right) Parks. Convergence in the foreground is that of West 211th and Isham Streets. Shown on the left and with a flag atop, is an old school at the S.E. corner of Broadway and Academy Street. Opposite same and towards the center is the old Dyckman Farmhouse, which, is today located in Dyckman House Park, at the N.W. corner of West 204th Street. The 3-storied, square frame structure to the right of the latter is No. 54-56 Cooper Street, which still stood in 1927, though surrounded by apartment\nbuildings.\n\nAbout 1910.\n\nBrown Brothers.\n",
