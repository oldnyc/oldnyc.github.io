    "text": "76 Washington Square South (formerly 290 4th Street) at the S.W. corner of Wooster Street (Washington Square East). This is supposed to be the oldest house now standing on Washington Square. Washington Square South is part of 4th Street as originally laid out. In 1833, when 4th Street absorbed Asylum Street in Greenwich Village, the whole was renumbered from the northwest end at Gansevoort and 13th Streets. About 1860 the section from MacDougal to Wooster Streets was given its own house numbers as Washington Square South. October 4, 1928.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
