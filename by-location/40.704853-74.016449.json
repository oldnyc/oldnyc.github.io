    "original_title": "Manhattan: West Street - Battery Place",
    "text": "A novel example of the set-back design of one building helping its neighbor---the tall downtown athletic club in the center and the thirty-one story office building known as 21 West St. at the right, showing how the office structure was enabled to enjoy southern exposure on both the Washington St. and West St. sides of the site by virtue of the adjoining club building being set back from its bullding line at the street level. Thus the office building enjoys the unique position of an isolated structure with its Washington, Morris and West St. Frontages affording it light from all four directions. The Building at the left is the Whitehall Building at Battery Place.\nNo date.\n",
