    "text": "Metropolitan Avenue, north side, east from 65th Street to Mt. Olivet Crescent, showing in the background a section of Lutheran Cemetery. In the foreground at the left are the steps leading to the Major house (brick) which is located at the N.W. corner of the above mentioned Streets. Beyond it is a two story house. The peaked section was once a one story peaked roof house of Chas. Way. The roof was removed and a story added about 50 years ago (1874), by Conrad Arzberger who also erected the flat two story extension. The next house is on the site of the old Ehrman house. About 1890 his son Charles built the present structure. The next two houses belonged to Judge Robert Burroughs (also Supervisor) who married a Way. In the first of the last two homes lived the judge. The other house he sold to one Deloughy a florist. His estate still owns it.\n\nFeb. 1924.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
