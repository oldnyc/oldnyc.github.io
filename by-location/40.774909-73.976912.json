Of these three, only the oldest, the Dakota (built between 1879 and 1885) stands today. The Majestic and San Remo have been replaced by apartment houses bearing the same names. The wooden building nearer the Majestic is a saloon, with a beer wagon in front of it drawn by the brewer's big horses. 1895.\n\nAugust Loeffler, from Ewing Galloway Collection.\n",
