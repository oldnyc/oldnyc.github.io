This is bounded on its three sides by Seventh Ave. (extreme left), West 117th Street (left foreground) and St. Nicholas Ave. (center foreground); its apex being at West 116th Street.\n\nThis thoroughfare in earlier days was known as the Harlem Road to Kingsbridge and the easterly side of same followed the easterly side of the present Ave. as shown in the building line to the left. That on the right sets back approximately 30 feet; St. Nicholas Ave. being that much wider.\n\nThe four corner apartment houses seen are, from left to right; the Graham Court (1923-37 Seventh Ave., east side, from 116th to 117th Streets); the Wilhelmina (1917-19 Seventh Ave., at the S.E. corner of 116th Street); the Acadia (No. 1889-93 Seventh Ave., and 91-97 St. Nicholas Ave., the apex at West 115th Street), and the Elnido (121 St. Nicholas Ave. and 201-5-11 West 116th Street, at the N.W. corner).\n\nJune 1905\n\nGeorge L.
