The history of this area is that Thomas Stevenson had a patent in 1651 on the Rev. Francis Doughty farm which lay between the Old Bowery Road and Flushing Bay and south of Mill Creek or as it is also known as Jackson Creek. In 1787 it became the property of Abraham Rapelye. He built a dock on Flushing Bay just south of the mouth of Jackson's Creek which in those days was probably at 96th Street, and south of this house between Old Bowery Bay Rd. and the Hazard tract which was also purchased by Daniel Rapelye. It was later known as Strongs farm; it being the property of Aletta Rapelye Strong. The successive owners that followed were Wm. W.
