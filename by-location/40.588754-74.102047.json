Butler's and Beers's maps of 1853 and 1874, respectively, show the house to have been owned by J. Barnes. In 1898 it belonged to Captain E. F. Keegan and was then known as \"Sunny Side'; in 1907 the Dongan Hill Feed and Grain Company owned it; and in 1917 the Richmond County Agricultural Society. Mr. P. L. Sperr states that this house is an Egbert house; the writer of these lines did not,however, find any evidence in support of the statement. Though a large tract of land belonging to J. Egbert lay directly north of the house and adjoined the Barnes property, the maps of the aforemmentioned dates do not show the dwelling to have belonged to Egbert. It may, though, have helonged to Egbert at an earlier date. The view is eastward across Dongan Hills toward the Lower New York Bay and Hoffman Island, as seen from Flagg Place.\n",
