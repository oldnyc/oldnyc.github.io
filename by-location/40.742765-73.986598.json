On the lower right is the recently erected Appellate Division of the Supreme Court Building.\n\nClose observation thru the center discloses the cleared site of the fire-destroyed 71st Regiment Armory at 34th Street and Fourth Avenue.  Upon 5th Avenue are observed, the Marble Collegiate Church, the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria, the Brick Presbyterian Church, the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas and St. Thomas F.E. Church.  The spires of St. Patricks Cathedral are outlined against the Hotel Sherry-Netherland.  On the lower left is building debris at the S.W. corner of 5th Avenue and 26th Street.  A structure there, that adjoined the corner (No. 202 Fifth Avenue) was removed in June of 1902.\n\nAbout 1902\n\nEwing Galloway",
