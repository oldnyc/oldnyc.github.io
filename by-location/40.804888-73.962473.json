The foundations, shown in the photographs, are already complete. The Nave will be 225 feet long, and the cost is estimated at between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000. The temporary wall at the eastern end of the Nave foundation will be torn out when the Nave is built, so that Nave and crossing will join.\n\nThe portion of the Cathedral here shown-the crossing with the choir in black- was completed in 1921. The Nave's width will be 132 feet and the height of the interior is to be 130 feet. Transcripts to be erected at each side of the crossing will make the total width of the Cathedral 315 feet.\n\nfrom the Review of Reviews\n",
