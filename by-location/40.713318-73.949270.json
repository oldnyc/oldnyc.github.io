    "text": "36-42 Devoe Street, south side, just west of Lorimer Street, showing the J . A. Rhodes' saw factory. It was built on 1850. This is the rear of the factory. Although Mr. Armbruster states that the factory was located on Ainslie Street near Tenth Street, the present (1941) Keap Street, the writer of these lines was unable to locate any saw factory at that location from 1874 to the present. The only saw factory, or file factory (the two are used interchangeably in the old Brooklyn business directories), in this area appears in Bromley's 1880 map on the south side of Devoe Street (which is one block north of Ainslie Street), just west of Lorimer Street. It is very likely that this is the saw factory Mr. Armbruster has in mind.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection  about 1890\n",
