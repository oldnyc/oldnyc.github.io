The Noon Day Prayer group utilize a portion of this structure today.\nMay 1923.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n\nThe Herald-Tribune of March 22, 1939, page 21, carries an article stating that this structure and the adjoining buildings to the east, comprising the lower half of this block (all owned by the Collegiate Reformed Protestant Church since 1664) are to be demolished and their sites improved with a modern 7 story office building. This will be erected by the George A. Fuller Co. and completed in 1941 for the use of the Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. and its' affiliates. It will front 150 feet on Fulton St., 120 feet on William St., and about 150 feet on Ann St. An investment of $4,000,O0O is involved; the church receiving $3,000,O00 in rent during the life of a lease, which is for\n21 years with two renewals, a total of 63 years.\nThe building shown here is the oldest of the group and was erected about 1855, directly after the congregation had moved to the Marble Collegiate Church (1851-4) at the N. W. corner of Fifth Avenue and W. 29th Street. The Fulton Street Prayer Meeting has met here since their organization in September 1857.\n",
