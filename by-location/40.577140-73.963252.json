The work was started on March 20, 1878. When this hotel was first erected it was 600 feet from high water, but in 1888 the Atlantic had undermined the foundations necessitating the placing of the hotel upon piles. However, on April 3, 1888 it was moved inland 500 feet by B.C. Miller and sons who contracted the work. The hotel was razed in 1924. The owners or lessees of this hotel were Breslin and Sweet 1879, Leland 1883, Cunningham and Hatfield 1888, and E. Clark King 1902-1909.\n\nDecember 1923.\n\nEugene L.
