    "text": "163 Christopher Street, at the N. W. corner of Washington Street, showing \"T:cAvoy's Drug Storw\" which was operated by a loc9l charscter lovingly known as \"Mother McAvoy.\" To sailors and truckmen of the neighborhood she was more than a druggist. She was a friendly counsellor, and a 'bank\" and \"post office\" for sailors on their brief stays ashore. From her old-fashioned desk in the store and through her self-acquired knowledge of various foreign languages, and acting as a Notary Public she helped many sailors turn to land lubbering. Proximity to the Federal Building increased her field of operations. She was born in Rome, N. Y. and was graduated from N. Y. C. P. in 1902. After clerking in several drug-stores she bought this little store for 13500. At this time her olientele consisted of many New Jersey people who commuted on the Christopher Street Ferry. She died at the age of 64.
