Little and Ives Co. plant at No. 425-35 E. 24th Street.\nThe shore line is being extended above 23rd Street, where the existing Exterior Street begins. The Drive will incorporate the latter to 17th Street. There it will veer to the waters edge (over new ground) to skirt Willard Parker Hospital and the N. Y. Edison Co. plant. The chimneys of the last mentioned are on the right and appear above the darkened utilitarian structure, the City's Motor Transport Building.\nNote the playground area being constructed in the foreground of View 1. This lies between 24th Street and 25th Street. The former recreation pier at the foot of 24th Street has been removed. Incidentally, this title is a misnomer, as the use for same was discontinued during the 1st World War. The U. S. Government took control for transport service and never relinquished it.\nA future seaplane landing platform has been constructed at the foot of 23rd Street. The Greenpoint Ferry slips were formerly there.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nOctober 13, 1939\nViews 1,2,3\n",
