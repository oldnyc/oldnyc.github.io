Not all of the corner building (435 West Broadway or 142-140 Prince Street) is shown in this view. No. 433, the six-story loft building in the center of the picture, was built about 1895 on the site of the frame house which stood at 117 South Fifth Avenue. This was just at the time when the name and numbering of this street were\nchanged.\nAbout 1919.\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n",
