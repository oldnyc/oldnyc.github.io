    "text": "Charlton Street, west from, but not including, MacDougal Street. The slightly taller house at the extreme right is No. 1 1/2 Charlton Street. Between Nos. 9 and 11, on the north side, is a little gap, which exactly marks the old boundary line between the West Bayard Farm, on the east, and Trinity Church Farm, on the west.\n\nIn the middle of Charlton Street, between this point and Varick Street (where a new building is nearing completion), once stood the famous Richmond Hill House, built by Major Abraham Mortier in 1760, used in 1776 as a headquarters by General Washington, occupied in 1789 by Vice-President and Mrs John Adams, and then leased by Aaron Burr. Charlton Street was originally laid out as Hetty Street or Burr Street, and took its present name in 1807. The old mansion ended as a roadhouse, and was demolished in 1849.\n\nThis picture was taken the year before the digging of the Eighth Avenue (municipal) Subway and the extension of Sixth Avenue south from Minetta Lane to Walker and Church Streets. In the process, Nos. 2 to 10 Charlton Street, on the south side, and 1 to 7 on the north side, will be demolished, leaving No. 9, the building with the round-arched doorway, as the house at the N.W. corner of Sixth Avenue.\n\n1926.\n",

No. 34 Macdougal Street, at the S.E. corner of Prince Street, will become 204 Sixth Avenue, No. 32 is the Second Assembly District Republican Club, and No. 28 (future 198 Sixth Avenue), next to the five-story police station, which is flying the flag, is, or used to be, the Richmond Hill settlement house, named after the Richmond Hill mansion which stood in what is now the middle of Charlton Street (q.v.) between Macdougal and Varick Streets. Charlton Street received its present name in 1807, and has so far escaped being made an extension of Prince Street, the way Brannon Street was swallowed by Spring Street, and (later), Hammersley by Houston (q.v.).\n\n1926.\n",
