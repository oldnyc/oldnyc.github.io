This structure was built before the Revolution, on land, sold August 4, 1796, by Nicholas de Peyster to George Pollock, a linen merchant who named the place for its beautiful trees and shrubbery, \"Strawberry Hill.\" His 5 year old son, St. Claire Pollock, fell off the cliffs and was drowned July 15, 1797. His father subsequently went to New Orleans, where his descendants there, are said to be called Polk. His land, expressly reserving the burial place containing the urn of his boy, which may still be seen near Grant's Tomb, was sold in 1803 to Joseph Alston, the husband of Theodosia Burr, who deeded it to Michael Hogan, the former British Consul at Havana. The latter named the place \"Claremont\" after the residence in Surrey of Prince William, Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV. The Earl of Devon, while living here in 1807, witnessed the trial of Fulton's \"Clermont\", and in 1815 an occupant was Joseph Bonaparte, the ex-King of Spain. The City finally bought the property, and since 1872 it has been a famous public restaurant. The land to the east and south of same is historical, being the scene of several of the sharpest engagements of the Battle of Harlem Heights on September 16, 1776.\n\nAbout 1907.\n\nWurts Brothers.\n",
