The dwellings in the left foreground were subsequently demolished leaving a vacant space which until 1933 was used as a Parking lot. In October of that year plans were filed for the Netherland Bldg. Across the skyline appears structures forming the Times Square-Broadway-Central Park -Columbus Circle area and composed mainly of hotels; prominent of which are the: Bristol, Maryland, Plymouth, Taft, Park-Central and Essex House.
