    "text": "Stapleton, Staten Island: The view is directly east across the town as seen from near Howard Avenue in Grymes Hill. The thoroughfare on the extreme right is Laurel Avenue; in the center background, directly preceding the S. S. Aquitania moving up the harbor, is the U. S. Marine Hospital; to the right of it is the four-story Mariners' Family Asylum, at 119 Tompkins Avenue. Some of the piers, especially those to the left of the hospital, later became part of the Foreign Trade Zone. Across the bay is Brooklyn.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nApril 22, 1932\n",
