It was chartered in 1771 and the cornerstone of the first building laid in 1775. When it was nearly completed, it was destroyed by fire. Work of rebuilding was at once begun, but was interrupted by the outbreak of the Revolution, and the institution did not receive patients until January 1791. In 1869, the original buildings were demolished and work on this building, which was completed in 1877, began. It will be demolished in 1934.\n\nFebruary 12, 1928.\n\nP.L. Sperr.",
