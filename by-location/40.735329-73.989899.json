Scrap Book of the Revolution. No date.\n\n\"Union Square located at the convergence of several Streets, where 4th Avenue and the old Bowery Road met, made it necessary to have there a Common. At times it was used as a Potter's Field, much of it's area being covered with rude shanties, but surrounded by fine mansions. It remained the Belgrade of Manhattan until about 1845, when homes were moved farther North.\"\n\nP.40. King's Handbook of New York.\n",
