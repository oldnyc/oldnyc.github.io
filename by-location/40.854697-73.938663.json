At the left is a corner of Dr. Chas. V. Paterno's manorial estate and upon which an apartment project is taking shape, necessitating demolition of the aforementioned individuals castle-like home. Chittenden Place normally runs parallel to the boulevard but here it has absorbed that short street that joins both thoroughfares.\n\nAugust 23, 1938.\n\nP.L. Sperr\n",
