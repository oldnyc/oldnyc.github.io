The drug store on the corner will be succeeded about 1929 by a lunch room, and the building will be remodelled downstairs so as to put the stairs on the western end, making more room for the restaurant. The shoe repair shop will go out of business at that time or earlier. Notice the law and bail bond offices; Jefferson Market Court is situated on the south-west corner, right across the street.\nThis street, which is parallel with Christopher, Charles, and Perry Streets, happens to coincide at the point with the western end of Amos Street was dropped, and the street later renumbered as an extension of West 10th Street, 100 being added to the Amos Street numbers.\n\nFebruary, 1922.\nGift of K.
