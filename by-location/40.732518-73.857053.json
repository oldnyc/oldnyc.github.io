There was another house north of the Plank Road east of 99th Streets. These properties belonged to the Hyatt and Garretson families. E.L. Armbruster states this house to be the Baxter house and states that it stood on Old Mill Road (now known as 63rd Road) west of Marlowe Avenue. (now 99th Street). The writer believes this house to be one of the aforementioned.\n\nAbout 1908\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
