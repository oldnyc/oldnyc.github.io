    "text": "Sixth Avenue-Extension, south from Bleecker Street, showing the slice-through that eliminated Hancock Street from Manhattan maps. Under construction is the Municipal subway. The center foreground was the former site of the R. C. Church of Our Lady of Pompeii (St. Carlos Missionary Fathers). On the left are several six story apartment houses, that formerly bore No's. 1-3, 5-7 and 9-13 Hancock Street. These will remain, acquiring 6th Avenue identities. On the extreme right is the rear of the Downing Street site, upon which in 1941 will rise a modern apartment structure, No. 10 Downing Street. The new west line of the Avenue will run there, forming the easterly side of this building plot. The partially demolished 6-story structures shown there front on West Houston Street. They will remain. Through the center is Congress Street, a short thoroughfare extending south of West Houston to King Street. This is to be included in the new thoroughfare.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nMay 12, 1927\n",
