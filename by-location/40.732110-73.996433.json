Eighth Street, west of Broadway, used to be called Clinton Place, the houses being numbered west from Broadway. The name and numbering was changed in 1899. As may be seen in this picture, the street has already lost its residential character. Nearly thirty years later this scene will not have changed greatly. Mr. Glider's house will have been remodelled like No. 9; the parlor store will be occupied by Fred Leighton's Indian Trading Post, and the basement by a gown shop and an interior decorator.\n\nApril 11, 1906.\n\nBrown Brothers.\n",
