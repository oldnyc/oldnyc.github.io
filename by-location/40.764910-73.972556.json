    "text": "No. 1, NRA Parade. A group of the Warner Brothers-Vitaphone employees awaiting their turn in the parade. In June 1933, during the fourth month of Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was passed by Congress and signed by the President. This act delegated to the President the right to draft codes for industries, which established, among other things, minimum wages and maximum hours. Under the provisions of this act, President Roosevelt created the National Recovery Administration (NRA), with General Hugh S. Johnson as Administrator. Industries were invited to draft their own codes and submit them to General Johnson and his staff for approval. Pending the adoption of these codes, all businesses, big and small, were invited to subscribe to a blanket code draft by Roosevelt, and known as the NRA (President's Recovery Agreement). All those who did so received a token of compliance to poster bearing the Blue Eagle clothing in the foot of the cog-wheels of industry, and in the other streaks of lightning. During its early days, NRA was greeted with almost fanatical, not to say hysterical, support by both business and labor. Only from the communists and a few other minor radicals did it receive bitter denunciation. In New York City this enthusiasm expressed itself in the form of a monster parade, surpassing in size the other parades. It formed at Washington Square, and marched north on Fifth Avenue to 60th Street, where it disbanded. The first group of marchers left Washington Square around two o'clock in the afternoon and reached midnight before the last marchers reached 66th Street and the parade disbanded. The picture gives a glimpse of the individual portions of the parade; but it is impossible to get any idea of its size or the enthusiasm of the participants. Anyone who has interest in the history of NRA will find it a most interesting chapter. Within six months the popularity of NRA began to wane. An attempt was made to revive the NRA enthusiasm and the slogan 'Buy under the Blue Eagle' was used, but it was unsuccessful. In the Schechter case, the Supreme Court declared the NRA codes unconstitutional. The NRA was popularily known as 'Roosevelt's New Deal.' The NRA still exists, but without the codes it has little meaning. All Blue Eagles have been repealed, and it is a penal offense to display one. The codes have been held to be violations of the minimum wages, maximum hours, and fair practice clauses. September 13, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n\nNo. 2, NRA Parade.
