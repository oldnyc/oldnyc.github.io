This church edifice dates from between 1879 and 1885, but the church was organized in 1805, and later took over the former Free Congregational Church at 149-151 Sullivan Street adjoining, where the six-story tenement house is shown in this view. The site of the present church was occupied by a brewery. St. Anthony of Padua was the first Italian Roman Catholic congregation to be organized in New York. An unsuccessful attempt to do something for the Italians of New York\nhad been made in 1859.\nJune 15, 1930.\nL. Sperr.\n",
