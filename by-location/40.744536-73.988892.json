The building on the S.W. corner of 28th Street will also stand in 1936, but six stories will have been added to it, to make it an eleven-story building.  The buildings in the next block will survive with little change, as Proctor's Fifth Avenue Theatre, and later simply the Fifth Avenue Theatre.\n1889.\nBrown Brothers.\n",
