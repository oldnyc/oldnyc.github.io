The Lenox Library has combined with the Astor and Tilden foundations to form the New York Public Library, and will move into the new building, which is now under construction on the\nsite of the Fifth Avenue reservoir, around 1910.\nHenry Clay Frick will build his mansion on this site, and in 1935 this mansion will be converted into a public art gallery.\n1905.\nAugust Loeffler, from P.
