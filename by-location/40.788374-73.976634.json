It is 13 stories tall and features Italian Renaissance style decorative elements. It features two massive, two story grand archways that provide entrance to an inner courtyard with landscaped gardens.\n\nThe Belnord is one of a mere handful of full-block apartment buildings in New York. Like other full-block buildings, such as The Apthorp, the Belnord is built around a large, landscaped interior courtyard.The Belnord's courtyard is among the largest in the city.",
