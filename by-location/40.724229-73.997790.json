U.S. Grant, marching northward to the temporary tomb in Riverside Park. Leading to this conclusion is the fact that August, Bernheim, Bauer & Co. occupied No. 516 Broadway between 1882 and 1886 and subsequently became Bernheim, Bauer & Co. in 1888, occupying quarters at 507-9-11 Broadway (opposite side of this thoroughfare).\n\nAn account of this funeral appears in Harpers Magazine of October 1885 (Vol. LXXI) on page 806; and the Independent of August 6, 1885 (Vol. 37) on page 15.\n\nAugust 8, 1885.\n",
