To the right appear, the No. 10 E. 40th Street Building, the 500 Fifth Avenue Building (under construction) and the recently completed Lefcourt National Building (No. 295 Madison Avenue, completed late 1929;) In the left corner of No. 1 is a portion of the Second Avenue \"El\" with its 34th Street station and spur line at the left margin of No. 2. This last mentioned feature was demolished in the Summer of 1938. E. 35th Street is the thoroughfare passing thru the center of this view. Note the spire of the Church of the Epiphany at Lexington Avenue. This structure was razed about the same time as the 34th Street spur line.\n\nSept. 17, 1939\nViews: 1 and 2\n\nP. L. Sperr\n",
