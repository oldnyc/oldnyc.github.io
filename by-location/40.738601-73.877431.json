    "text": "Broadway at the S.W. corner of 51st (struck out: Maurice) Avenue, showing four views of the former St. James Episcopal Church. It was erected about 1735. Pews were installed in 1740. In 1760 the edifice was repaired and the steeple rebuilt. It was enlarged about 177O and again repaired about 1816. In 1922 it was painted. The last services in this structure were held on July 16, 1848 when the new edifice was dedicated for service. This place has since been used as a chapel. The steeple was removed about 1900. A small burying ground is located in the rear of this chapel. The Rev. Evan Malbone Johnson, b 1792, was the rector from 1814-1827, when he removed to Brooklyn and there had erected the first St. John's Church in Brooklyn.\n1922\nViews 1 and 2\nViews 3 & 4: May 1923.\nEugene L.
