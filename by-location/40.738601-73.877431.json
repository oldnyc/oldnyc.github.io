    "text": "Broadway, west side, between Queens Boulevard and Fifty-first Ave., showing in a set of two views the Wandowenock Fire House and the Registers office of Newtown. The buildings in this view were demolished in 1930 because of the extension through here of the Independent Subway lines. In View No.1, in which both buildings are seen distinctly; the building at the left is the fire house; the other which housed the office of the Newtown Register acquired its present outlines by adding to buildings already erected. A section of the first story was a school house erected about 1700 and was the first in the village. This building was enlarged in 1840. Then in 1873 another story was erected and the tower added by the Hon. Chas. White, founder of the Register.\n---Arthur White.",
