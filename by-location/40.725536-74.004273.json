    "text": "Macdougal Street, north from the eastern end of the westernmost section (originally Brannon Street) of Spring Street (q.v.). This is the real beginning of Macdougal Street, although during the southward extension of Sixth Avenue (1927-1930) the latter will absorb the first two blocks of it. The Butterick Building, built in the winter of 1902-1903 as 1 Macdougal Street or 223-221 Spring Street, will become the N.W. corner of Sixth Avenue and Spring Street. Nos. 20 to 34 Macdougal Street, on the east side from Van Dam Street to Prince Street, will become 186 to 204 Sixth Avenue, and Nos. 2 to 18 and 9 to 35 Macdougal Street will be demolished. At the right of this picture, you can see the frame side of 219 Spring Street, which, with its neighbors 217 and 215 Spring Street, two similar brick-faced houses, is directly in the path of Sixth Avenue Extension. No. 2 Macdougal Street is the first five-story tenement house at the right, adjoining 219 Spring Street. Between No. 4 and No. 8 (the two-story stable) there is a short alley at right angles to the street. Macdougal Street is the seventh of a set of streets laid out west of and parallel to Broadway. After the end of the American Revolution they were renamed in honor of various Generals in the successful war for independence.\n\n1926.\n",

The Butterick Building, erected in the winter 1902-03, at the right, will become the N.W. corner of Sixth Avenue and Spring Street. Adjoining the Butterick Building, and opposite the northern end of Clark Street (which will become part of the west side of Sixth Avenue), the new Vivadou Building is under construction (see also Vandam Street). At the southwest corner of Varick Street may be seen part of the American News Building, built two or three years before this picture was taken. The absorbtion of Brannon Street by Spring Street took place about 1807, and is one of the earliest examples of a process which went on in the city's street nomenclature all through the Nineteenth Century. \"The Villager\" attributes the name Brannon to the family of a man of that name who kept a public house in this neighborhood up to 1861.\n\n1926.\n",
