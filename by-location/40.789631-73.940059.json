    "text": "Feast of St. Anthony of Padua, 1923, No. 1: This festival, portrayed in this and subsequent views, is not the regular feast of St. Anthony of Padua, which according to the church calendar, should occur on June 13. This has its origin in an early September festival brought over to this country by immigrants from Brusciano, a suburb of Naples. The Bruscianese settled on the east side of First Avenue, and evidently found Labor Day weekend a convenient time for their annual festival. On Saturday they prepare the tall tower, and also parade their statue of St. Anthony around the upper east side Italian section. Then on Monday (Labor Day) the tower is carried back and forth on 106th Street; and an enormous crowd turns out for it. This festival in 1923 is the fifth annual Festa dei Bruscianesi (Festival of the Bruscianese). It will be held here every year until 1932, when the children will have a little Festa of their own, financial stringency inhibiting their elders. There will be one more Festa in 1934, but not in 1935; the opinion of the neighborhood in 1935 seems to be that it will not be continued as a regular annual affair. The first picture shows the boat (evidently part of the saint's legend), which is carried in the procession. St. Anthony stands in the center; and the mast is surmounted by an eagle. Notice the fine figurehead, representing a two-tailed mermaid. The view is east on 106th Street, east of First Avenue. See No. 8. September 3, 1923.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n\nNo. 2.
