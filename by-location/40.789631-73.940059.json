This has its origin in an early September festival brought over to this country by immigrants from Brusciano, a suburb of Naples. The Bruscianese settled around 106th Street and First Avenue, and evidently found Labor Day week-end a convenient time for their annual festival. On Saturday they prepare the tall tower, and also parade their statue of St. Anthony around the upper east side Italian section. Then on Monday (Labor Day) the tower is carried back and forth on 1Obth Street; and an enormous crowd\nturns out for it.\nThis festival in 1923 is the fifth annual Festa dei Bruscianesi (Festival of the Bruscianese). It will be held here every year until 1932, when the children will have a little Festa of their own, financial stringency inhibiting their elders. There will be one wore Festa in 1934, but not in 1955; the opinion of the neighborhood in 1935 seems to be that it will not be continued as a regular\nannual affair.\nThe first picture shows the boat (evidently part of the saint's legend), which is carried in the procession.
