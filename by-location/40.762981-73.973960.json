It was demolished in 1927, and the site is now occupied by the Bergdorf Goodman store.\nThe first church spire on the west side is the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian; beyond it are those of St. Thomas's (Protestant-Episcopal), Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas (Dutch Reformed), and, dimly in the background, the Brick Presbyterian and the Marble Collegiate (Dutch Reformed). These churches are still standing (1935); but St. Thomas's has been rebuilt after it was partially destroyed by fire.\n\nAbout 1890.\n\nBrown Brothers.\n",

The group of houses, known as Marble Row, were notable as representing practically the first break with the brownstone tradition in New York. This house, the first of the group, was occupied by Mrs. Jones herself. Its last resident was Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs; and in 1918 the New York Trust Company bought and remodelled it. In November 1929 it will be demolished to make room for the new 15-story New York Trust Company Building.\n\nJune, 1925.\n",
