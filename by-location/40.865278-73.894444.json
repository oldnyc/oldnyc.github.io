    "text": "EDGAR ALLAN POE.\n(Died Oct. 7, 1849.)\nHear the tolling of the bells\u2014\nDeath bells!\nWhat a strain of tragedy! Eider harsh instance knelling!\n\"He is dead!\" rings seem to say,\n\"And Poe rests endless clay in\nIs forgotten.\n\nIs forgotten; in forgotten ere it's cold.\nHe is dead, dead, dead!\nAnd there's none will shed a tear.\n\nNever fear!\nThere are none with a tear.\n\nOh, the bells, bells, bells!\nHow each one seems awash with predication.\nEvery echo and vibration,\nWith a broken culmination,\nSeems to hover in the air.\nSeems to hover everywhere,\nSeems in derision.\n\n\"He is dead, dead, dead!\" sing the\nbells.\nFoolish bells, lying bells:\nHear the pealing of the bells\u2014\nJoyous bells!\n\nWhat a tale of ecstasy their haunting\ntells:\n\"He is gone!\" So they seem to say,\n\"House seem to sing.\n\n'Tis man we celebrate today.\n\"He is long years dead, ye cry? Cause your clatter, fine people.\nSing a the only thing steeple.\nIt is only fools that die!\n\nEvery echo seems to call him.\nThe man we celebrate today\n\nAnd the grave deepens ever deeper. Hear the peal ever deeper, as it penetrates the tomb.\n\nAs it filters through the gloom And his spirit wraps the spirit of his\nbride.\n\n\"I am his bride!\nYoung she died!\nAnd his broken heart was buried at her\nside.\n\nSo, together in the silence of the tomb, They lie, side by side, in that narrow, narrow\nroom.\n\nHear the bells, the bells, the bells, To the jibes, mocking laughter of the\nbells.\n\nVILDA SAUVAGE OWENS.\n",
