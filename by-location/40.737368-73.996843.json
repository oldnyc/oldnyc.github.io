In 1848 it was re-organized, as an Irish regiment, and disbanded a few years later.  In 1859 it was again reformed.  In 1861, the entire command went to Washington, independently, and was sworn into the United States service for three years.  They formed the 83rd New York Volunteers, seeing service in the Wilderness, at Antietam, Fredericksburg, the second Bull Run, and Gettysburg.  Between 1870 and 1872 James Fisk was the colonel of the Ninth.

The vacant plot at the left was the site of the former Civic Repertory Theatre and upon which will rise a modern neighborhood motion-picture house.\n\nThis building was opened in 1866 as the Theatre Francaise [sic], and during the first year Jacob Grau presented Ristori there in her American premiere. The house was rebuilt in 1871 and renamed the Lyceum. As time passed, the type of productions changed , tho at one time it was a center of the social and dramatic life.\n\nIt became the 14th Street Theatre later and since 1926, the Civic Repertory Theatre. The New York Times of April 1, 1938 carried an article to the above effect.\n\nJune 16, 1938.\n\nP.L. Sperr",
