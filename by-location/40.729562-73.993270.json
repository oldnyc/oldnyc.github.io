    "text": "Broadway, west side, south from Waverly to Washington Places, showing the old New York Hotel occupying the entire frontage involved. This structure bore No. 721 and was a favorite resort of the Southerners before and after the Civil War. Many stories were told of how blockade running plots originated here. It was erected in 1847. Randolph Guggenheimer had it removed in 1896 for his 12 story New York Commercial Building. Note the absence of street car tracks.\n\nAbout 1870\n\nGift of Urbrock Collection\nNeg #307\n",
