This hotel is composed of three houses believed to have been originally built about 1855. A Mr. Martin altered them into one unit and opened them in 1853 as the Hotel Martin. In March 1902, the Martin became the Hotel Lafayette. The Lafayette, under the ownership of Mr. Raymond Orteig, is a French hotel, as was the Hotel Martin. It is especially renowned for its restaurant. Twenty-one years after the date of this picture it will be linked to the Lindbergh non-stop flight from New York to Paris, which will win the award offered by Mr. Orteig, the\nproprietor.\nApril 18, 1906.\nBrown Brothers.
