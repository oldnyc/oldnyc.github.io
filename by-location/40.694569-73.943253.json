    "text": "Throop Avenue, at the S. W. corner of Willoughby Avenue, showing the Throop Avenue Presbyterian Church. It had its origin in a mission established in 1852 on the corner of Throop Avenue and Bartlett Street. The Throop Avenue Presbyterian Church was organized in 1862 and occupied the Throop Avenue Mission Building between Hopkins and Ellery Streets, which was later turned into a synagogue. In 1867 it removed to the S. W. corner of Throop and Willoughby Avenues, occupying a frame structure. The cornerstone for the brick edifice, seen in this view, was laid on November 2, 1889. In 1890 the church was destroyed by fire and a new site was acquired for a new edifice at the N. W. corner of Throop Avenue and Macon Street, where the church is located to this day (1940). The building beyond the church, seen in this view, is between Willoughby and Vernon Avenues. Mr. Eugene L. Armbruster is authority for above references.\n\n1911\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
