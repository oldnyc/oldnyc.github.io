    "text": "Broadway, east side, south from Halsey Street. (In 1871 Paul W. Ledoux, a Canadian who resided in New York City, bought a lot of land bounded by Broadway, Bushwick Ave., and Eldert and Halsey Streets, on which 13 stores and several dwellings were erected. In 1891, he refused $100,000 for a 200 feet frontage on Broadway. In 1905 he sold 180' X 1O0' on Broadway for $225,000. He, among others, was instrumental in having the Halsey Street trolley line extended). Overhead is a portion of the\nBroadway line of the Brooklyn Elevated system.\nJuly 1924.\nEugene L.
