In 1891, he refused $100,000 for a 200 feet frontage on Broadway. In 1905 he sold 180' X 1O0' on Broadway for $225,000. He, among others, was instrumental in having the Halsey Street trolley line extended). Overhead is a portion of the\nBroadway line of the Brooklyn Elevated system.\nJuly 1924.\nEugene L.
