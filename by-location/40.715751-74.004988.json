    "text": "Broadway, west side, at Thomas Street (unopened), showing the old New York Hospital buildings that stood here from the American Revolution to 1869, when their function was removed to the new hospital on West 15th Street. The structure shown is the second, as the first (cornerstone laid in 1775) was destroyed by fire prior to completion. It was immediately rebuilt and nearly complete when the Revolution began. The unfinished building was occupied by the British and Hessian soldiers as a barrack and hospital, and it was not until January, 1791, that it was in a proper condition to receive patients.\n\nPrior to 1869\n\nGift of Urbrook Collection",
