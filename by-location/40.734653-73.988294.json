This structure was known as Amberg's Theatre in 1892, which opened here in 1888 and at which the Muenchener Company played on November 5, 1890. Upon this site formerly stood Irving Hall, opened December 20, 1860 for balls, lectures and concerts, and which was famous as a rendezvous for one faction of the Democratic party, to which it gave its name. Today (1938), this building is given over to Burlesque performances, a feature which aroused local interest when Judge Crain was District Attorney of Manhattan recently; this and adjoining property being in his family for years. A negative print accompanies this, forming a set of two.\n\nAbout 1900.\n",

The Hotel Du Nord, shown on the N.W. corner of 15th Street has only recently been known by that name, from around 1890 to after 1902.  This was the older Hotel America. (now at 102-06 East 16th St); In 1885 it was Hotel del Recreo, and in 1879 Belvedere House (probably its original name).\n\nThis building will finally be replaced around 1928 by a new 4-story structure called the Irving Plaza.  The houses above it, 21-33 Irving Place, will be demolished shortly after the time of this picture to make place for the 12-story structure later to be known as the Nemo Building.\n\nMarch 1909\nBrown Brothers\n\nTranscribers note: March 1909 appears to be the date of the photo. The information supplied for it appears to have been compiled decades later (Or else by a clairvoyant).\n",
