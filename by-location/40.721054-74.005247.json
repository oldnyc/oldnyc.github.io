Buildings appearing on the left are Nos. 10 to 2 inclusive, the 6-story structure being No. 6. On the right appear Nos. 7-5, 3 and 1. All of these buildings have disappeared, vacant lots occupying the York Street sites and a United States Post Office, the church site. The foreground of this view would be the present west side building line of the Sixth Ave. Extension.\n\nAbout 1914.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
