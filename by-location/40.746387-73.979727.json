Since the sale of this property (May 1936) to Dr. Charles V. Paterno, a real estate specialist, the congregation has been using the St. Thomas Chapel on East 60th Street as a temporary place of worship.

Crocker in 1933, who had held the position for 30 years.\nThis data was reported in THE NEW YORK SUN of SATURDAY,\nFEBRUARY 20, 1937.\nDr. Paterno traded this cleared site in 1939 for an apartment building on Central Park South.
