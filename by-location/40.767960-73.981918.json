Avenues run north and south and streets run east and west with mathematical and geometrical precision. Practically the only variation from that scheme - north of the \"downtown\" section - is Broadway, the old post road to Albany, whose slant the city planners found it impossible to change. Broadway intersects at a sharp angle most of the other thoroughfares, thus affording the only vistas in the entire borough and creating what are known as Union Square, Madison Square, Greeley or Herald Square, and Times Square. The picture above shows Broadway at the left and Central Park west, with the Maine\nMemorial at the entrance to the park.\n1924\nKadel and Herbert\n",
