Elevated construction had begun in 1867 with a single trunk line, operated by cables and stationary engine, on Greenwich street from Battery Place to Cortlandt Street, and subsequently extended up to Ninth Avenue and 30th Street. By 1876 the financial structure of the elevated companies was in shape, and construction of the Sixth and Third Avenue lines begun.  By 1880 substantially the present lines on Manhattan were completed; but steam was used till 1903.\n\n1879. (handwritten--c. 1914-5)\n\nEwing Galloway, Photographer.\n",
