    "text": "Park Avenue (called Fourth Avenue until about 1890) north from about 105th Street, showing two track railroad on wooden trestle.\n\nThe little wooded hill in right background is the future Mt. Morris Park. The deepest part of the old Harlem Creek bed is between 106th and 107th Streets. For some reason Drips' Plan of New York for 1867 and for 1868 utterly fails to show the big building in the center of the picture, which should be at about 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, nor any of the buildings just west of Fourth Avenue around 110th Street except the five small houses nearest the camera, on the S.W. corner of 110th Street. The steeple on the horizon to the right is probably the Mt. Morris Baptist Church at Fifth Avenue near 126th Street; this is, however, only a guess.\n\nThis photograph was used as an illustration in the first of Henry Collins Brown's Valentine's Manuals, 1916-17, opposite page 91.\n\n1860.\n\nNew York Edison Company Collection.\n\nNeg # 464\n",
