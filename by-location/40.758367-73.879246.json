On the opposite side of the Road is the Daniel Rapelje farmhouse, owned by S. Hirschman in 1909. All houses in this area no longer appear in 1926. If locating these houses in 1937 in the order above mentioned, they would be at the N.W. corner of 89th Street and Thirty-second Avenue, at the S.E. corner of 90th Street and Thirty-second Avenue; and at the S.E. corner of 89th Street and Thirty-second Avenue.
