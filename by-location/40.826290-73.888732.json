    "text": "Bryant Ave., West side, from Westchester Ave. to East 167th Street, showing the Hunt Inn which was erected in 1660. It stood in rear of the Foxhurst Mansion on the grounds bounded by the triangle of Westchester Ave., West Farms Road and East 167th Street. It was a prominent rendezvous of British officers during the American War for Independence. The inn was razed between 1900 and 1923 (according to d.W. Bromley maps) and its site is now (1937) occupied by a 6-story apartment house. 1890.\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
