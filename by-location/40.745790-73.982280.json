Stewart is a semi-charitable organization, on the site of the old N.Y. & Harlem Railway round-house (engine-house). It will stand here till 1925, (see Park Avenue). Compare this with the same view in 1906 (by Brown Bros.), which will show little change beyond better pavement, electrified street-cars, and subway entrances at 33rd Street. The old frame hotel and bar on the S.W. corner of 32nd Street will not be demolished till after 1910. About 1895.\n\nEwing Galloway, Photographer.\n",
