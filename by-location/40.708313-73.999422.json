No. 173 (old No. 174) is the house in which Alfred E. Smith was born on December 30, 1873. He served four terms as Governor of the State of New York and was Democratic candidate for President in 1928. Long in New York City and State politics, he is often referred to as \"New York's own Al Smith.\" He is a leading figure in the Society of Tammany and is one of the organizers of the Liberty League, an organization of leading industrialists and bankers of extremely conservative leanings in politics. Born and raised in the city slums, he had no more than a parochial school education. In later life, as a public personality he received several degrees as Doctor of Laws from Harvard, Columbia, Fordham, and other famous universities.\n\nAbout 1925.\n\nBrown Brothers.\n",
