The lot where it stands had long been vacant; in the 1880\u2019s William H. Vanderbilt, Esq., of the New York Central Railroad, used to turn out his famous mare \u201cMaud S.\u201d there, during the business day while he was in his office in the old Grand Central.\n\nThe next block is occupied by the Yale Club on the N.W. corner of 44th Street and the Vanderbilt Concourse Building on the S.W. corner of 45th Street, both built about the same time as the Biltmore or a little after.\n\nAt the time of this picture Vanderbilt Avenue has not yet been built across the railroad yards from 45th to 47th Streets. Opposite the Vanderbilt Concourse Building may be seen the northern end of the Pershing Square viaduct, used on this side for both north- and south-bound traffic till 1928. From 47th to 48th Streets Vanderbilt Avenue passes under the arcade between the two halves of a double hotel built about 1927, the eastern building of which is 270 Park Avenue. On Park Avenue at 51st Street the Hotel Ambassador is nearing completion.\n\nEarly 1920.\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n\n",
