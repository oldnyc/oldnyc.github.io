    "text": "Feast of Santa Rosalia, 1927. Shrine to Santa Rosalia, at 440 East 13th Street, north side (actually it's south), between First Avenue and Avenue A.\nSt. Rosalia, who came of an old Sicilian family, is the patron saint of Sicily and Palermo, but her feast is only celebrated locally.\nThe Sicilians celebrate it on September 3, the eve of her day on the calendar; at Monte Pellegrino, where her body was found in a cave, it is celebrated from July 11 to 15. This shrine on 13th Street, accordingly, seems to indicate the presence of Sicilian immigrants in the neighborhood.\nSeptember 5, 1927.\nP. L. Sperr",
