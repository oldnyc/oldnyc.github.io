Then comes the Main Hospital, built about 1909, its long axis nearly in line with 65th Street (which is not cut through east of the Avenue). Then the original laboratory, dedicated May 11, 1906, stands facing 66th Street and the Avenue. To the left of the picture Laboratory No. 2 is shown under construction, and behind it the chimney of\nthe original power house built in 1906.\nIn the right background, through b3rd Street, may be seen the East River, Blackwell's (now Welfare) Island, and Queens. This part of Avenue A, north of 59th Street, will not be called York Avenue till\nlate in 1928.\nEarly 1916.\n",
