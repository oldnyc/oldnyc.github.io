    "text": "Celebrations, Parades and Municipal Events: Evacuation Day Parade of 1883. A southeastward view of the annual demonstration that commemorated the British evacuation of New York on November 25, 1783. This was discontinued about 1914 or thereabouts. The photographer is at the S.W. corner of Fifth Avenue and 18th Street and shows troops moving northward up the Avenue. The buildings seen are on the east side of this thoroughfare between 17th and 18th Streets. The circular effect indicates the use of an early Kodak, a camera using roll film of 100 exposures and one of the first of this type.\n\nNovember 25, 1883\n\nWilliam Frederick Sherwood\n",
