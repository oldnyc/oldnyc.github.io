    "text": "Grace Court from east of Furman to Hicks Streets, showing at the S.W. corner Grace Church. It was once the Emanuel Protestant Episcopal Church which organized in 1841 and built its edifice at the N.E. corner of Sidney Place and Livingston Street, which was consecrated on March 3, 1842. In 1850 the structure was sold to catholics and became St. Charles Borromeo R.C. Church. The present structure of St. Charles Borromeo was dedicated May 24, 1869, as the former structure was destroyed by fire on March 8, 1868. The present Grace Church (Protestant Episcopal) built its present edifice in 1848.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
