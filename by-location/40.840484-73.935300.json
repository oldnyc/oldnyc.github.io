This Georgian structure was built as a country estate in 1765 by Roger Morris, a wealthy merchant Loyalist who returned to England in 1775. It served successively as headquarters for General Washington and the British-Hessian forces. After the war it was sold for a tavern and used as a stop-off point by Boston-New York stage coaches. It was bought in 1810 by Stephen\nJumel, a wine merchant, for his wife.\nBank of New York Calendar 1967-68\n",
