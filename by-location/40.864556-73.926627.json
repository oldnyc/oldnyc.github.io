To the right may be seen the south side of 30 Vermilyea Avenue, built around 1910, and to the left garages and little buildings on the east side of Broadway. In the center background is the old Public School No. 52, built in the 1860's for the village of Inwood, and located in what would have been the middle of Twelfth Avenue just above 205th Street, had the numbered avenues and streets been carried out up here as surveyed.\n\nOctober 26, 1927.\n\nP.L.
