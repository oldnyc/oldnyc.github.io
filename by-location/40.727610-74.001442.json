No. 132, adjoining the corner at the right, has been recently rebuilt, but the others are substantially the original block of low houses, set back a little from the sidewalk. Around 1910 this block was known as Ludlow Place. The original front stoops have almost all been removed and the basements re-modelled into stores.\n\nFebruary 20, 1932.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
