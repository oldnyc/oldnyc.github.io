In 1878 its name will be changed to the Standard Theatre, and it will finally be replaced by the Manhattan Theatre. This block will be occupied about 1915 by Gimbel Brothers' department store. Within a few weeks foundation work will begin on the Sixth Avenue Elevated Railroad.\n\nEarly spring, 1876.\nBrown Brothers.\n",
