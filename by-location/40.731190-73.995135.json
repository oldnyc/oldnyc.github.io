The office building on the S.E. corner of 8th Street, was originally built by Merck & Company, about 1895, on the site of old 42-38 Clinton Place (now 34 East 8th Street). On the S.E. corner of 9th Street is the Hotel Lafayette (formerly Hotel Martin), owned by Raymond Ortig (who put up the prize which Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., won by his famous solo flight in May, 1927). The new Devonshire House, apartment building, completed in 1928 on the site of the old University Place Presbyterian Church, is visible on the S.W. corner of 10th Street.\nMarch 25, 1933.\n\nP. L.

The small structures shown are studios that were formerly stables to the residences on Washington Square. They are a portion of the holdings of the Sailors Snug Harbor Corp. This came into being through the advice of Alexander Hamilton who suggested that Richard Randall leave his estate to the activity upon which the family fortune had sprung from.\n\n1939-40\n\nAlexander Alland, photo\n",
