    "text": "Madison Avenue, north from and including 55th Street, seen from 54th Street east of Madison Avenue. The streets have been graded, but building is only just getting under way.\n\nOn the N.E. corner of Madison Avenue and 57th Street the Madison Avenue Reformed Church, afterwards to become the Central Presbyterian Church, is nearing completion. This edifice will be demolished in 1928 (see New Fuller Building Progressive Series, 1928-29, Madison Avenue N.W. corner of 57th Street). On the N.E. corner of 57th Street stands the newly erected 1 East 57th Street, residence of Mrs. Mary Mason Jones, and the first of the block known as Marble Row. (See Fifth Avenue at N.W. corner of 57th Street, 1925, and other views). It will be demolished late in 1929. Two or three of the houses shown under construction on the north side of 57th Street, notably 17 West 57th Street (the western wing of the house with the mansard roof), will be standing in 1935.\n\nIn the background, on a line from the observer through the intersection of Madison Avenue and 56th Street, may be seen the old Arsenal in Central Park, used as a police station.\n\nThis photograph is reproduced in Valentine's Manual for 1923, on page 10, and credited to the collection of George S. Weston. We have taken the date as given by Valentine's Manual.\n\nMay 5, 1871.\n\nInternational News Photos, Inc.\n",
