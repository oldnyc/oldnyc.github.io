In the foreground are the Police Information\nBooth and a subway kiosk.\nThe Hotel Cadillac was erected in two units. The first to rise was the eight story corner structure. This was built as the Barrett House in 1883. The adjoining unit rose several years laterand was the first to bear the name Cadillac. In 1900 they were combined. For a brief period between 1910 and 1915 they were known as the Hotel Wallick. The land upon which they stand has been owned by the Goelet interests, passing from Ogden Goelet to his daughter May, the wife of the Duke of Roxburghe, and to her son the present Duke.\nFor a more complete account see the New York Times of March 19, 1940.\n\nGeorge L.
