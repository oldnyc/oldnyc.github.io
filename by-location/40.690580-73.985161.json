    "text": "Fastened to the wall of a building located on Fulton St. near Bridge St., Brooklyn, is this plaque telling a story that had\nits beginning more than three centurie ago.1\n\nIn those early colonial times in Brooklyn there were open spaces ,dotted with scattered structures. Among these stood an ocatgon Reformed Church in which, about July 4th., 1661, Carel DeBevoise, who had arrived a scant two years before as an emigrant from Holland, conducted the first school in Brooklyn.\nFrom the record we find \"Carel Dehevoise, a highly educated French Protestant, with his wife - nee Sophia Van Lodensteyn -and three children had sailed from Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the ship Otter, in February, 1659 and arrived on these shores\nshortly thereafter.\n\nCarel DeBevoise was more than schoolmaster:\n\n\"He was required as the rescript testifies, to act as court messenger, to serve sommons, conduct the services of the church, to lead the choir on Sundays, ring the bell for public worship, take charge of the school, and perform other occasional services. We can appreciate his embarrassment, and sympathize with his apprehensions in the performance of so many and such conflicting duties as are specially named; but when the monstrous addition is affixed 'and such other occasional services as the very worthy and ponderous schout and the dignified and exacting schepens should enact for his worriment,' human emotion is too feeble to be commensurate with the demand.\"\n\nYet insignificant as was the beginning the light has never been quenched. The tablet stresses this thought in the words: The Spark Here kindled Has Become a Great Flame Illumining the Path of Youth Unto Wisdom and Worth.\n",
