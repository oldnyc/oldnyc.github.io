Re can appreciate his embarrassment, and sympathize with his apprehensions in the performance of so many and such conflicting duties as are specially named; b t when the monstrous addition is affixed 'and such other occasional services as the very w0NINREE09fN9 and ponderous schout and the dignified and exaoting schepens should enact for his worriment,' human emotion is\ntoo feeble to be commensurate with the demmand.\"\nYet insignificant ss was the beginning the light has never heen cuenched. The tablet stresses this thought in the words:\nThe Spark Rere kindled Has Become a Great Flaie\nTllumining the Path of Youth Unto Tisdom and Iorth.\n",
