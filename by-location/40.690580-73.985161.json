    "text": "Fastened to the wall of a buildinglocatea on Fulton St. near Bridge St., Brooklyn, is this plache tella,a story that had\nits beginning more than three centurie ago.1\na, Dwo.ktgw. tWW2r2\nIn those early colonial times.were open spaces,dotted with scattered structures. .unong these stood an ocatgon Reformed Church in which, about July 4th., 1661, Carel DeBevoise, who had arrived a scant two years before as an emigrant from\nEolland, conducted the first school in Brooklyn.\nFrom the record we find \"Carel Dehevoise, a highly educated French Protestant, with his wife - nee Sophia Van Lodensteynand three children had sailed from Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the ship Otter, in February, 1659 and arrived on these shores\nshobtly thereafter.\nCarel DeBevoise was more than schoolmaster:\nNEe was required\nas the rescript testifies, to act as court messenger, to serve somcions, conduct the services of the church, to lead the cdoir on Sundays, ring the bell for public worship, take charge of the school, and perform other occasional services. Re can appreciate his embarrassment, and sympathize with his apprehensions in the performance of so many and such conflicting duties as are specially named; b t when the monstrous addition is affixed 'and such other occasional services as the very w0NINREE09fN9 and ponderous schout and the dignified and exaoting schepens should enact for his worriment,' human emotion is\ntoo feeble to be commensurate with the demmand.\"\nYet insignificant ss was the beginning the light has never heen cuenched. The tablet stresses this thought in the words:\nThe Spark Rere kindled Has Become a Great Flaie\nTllumining the Path of Youth Unto Tisdom and Iorth.\n",
