The park was improved at a cost of ~80,00O and then operated by him for two years. He leased it then to Barney Koenig. John H. Gerken purchased the park in 1909. In 1923 Welz and Zerweck were the owners. The 1908 Atlas of Queens County also shows that in 1908 it was known as the Greater New York Park and that the owner was C.J. Hettsheimer.
