The centre building, fronting on Broadway and Sixth Avenue, was formerly the Seventy-First Regiment Armory, and is now the New York Herald Building. Later, in 1928, it will be cut in half; the narrower, southern half will remain, and in 1936 will house the Rogers Peet Company. The 35th Street half, however, will be demolished and replaced by the 24-story Herald Square Building. In the background is the recently built Times Building, which has caused the name of Longacre Square to be changed to Times Square. About 1905.",
