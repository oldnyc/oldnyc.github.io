When this station was built in 1871 the railroad began by leaving the engine here and having the cars pulled down to Madison Square by horse; some years before the date of this picture even that had ceased, and this station became a terminal for all trains.

If that is true, then the new Interborough Subway lines have just been opened (notice passengers from the new Grand Central express station coming up to the street in the foreground), the name Pershing Square for this block has just been suggested by John M. Bowman, and not yet officially adopted, General Pershing is still distinguishing himself in the War, and this is\nSummer, 1918.\n",

On the right may be seen the old spur from the Third Avenue \"L\", to be taken down in 1924, and a glimpse of the little alley, between Grand Central Station and the Hotel Commodore, which used to be DePew Place, balancing Vanderbilt Avenue.\nTraffic is quite light over the viaduct, even if it is only 11:15 A. M. Both north and south bound traffic travels around the west shoulder of the station, between 42nd and 45th Streets; the viaduct to the east is yet a dead-end leg, for the convenience of the Commodore Hotel. As yet no statue of Commodore Vanderbilt stands in front of the great central window, facing north bound automobile traffic.\nLate 1922.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",

Like the Mercury on the present Grand Central they're all poised for flight but never fly.\"\n\nA return address label is attached to the map with the following on it:\nHARCOURT STRANGE\n145 Fourth Avenue\nMount Vernon, N. Y. 10550\n\nOn a separate slip of paper attached to the back of the photo appears the following:\n\"According to a feature article appearing in The N.Y. News Coloroto  [sic] Magazine Jan. 2, 1966 the above cast iron eagle was one of 16 which once adorned the top of the old Grand Central Station on 42 St. N.Y.C.  Those birds were added to the remodelled station in 1898.  But only remained on their perch for 5 years. Then were removed when the station was rebuilt in 1903. The News illustrated 9 of the 16 in their present locations. The one above and another are now on Villa St. Mount Vernon, N.Y. (over for map.)\"\n",
