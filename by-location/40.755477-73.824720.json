In August 1823 when he was elected to the United States Senate in place of Rufus King. Dr. James and his brother Allen Macdonald purchased Sanford Hall after 1841 and moved their private sanitarium from Murray Hill in New York City in 1845 to this place. This property was sold in 1924 to a group of real estate operators. The buildings were still occupied as a sanitarium in 1909. In 1873 this property extended from Jamaica Ave. on the west, to Parsons Ave. on the east, and from a point south of Franklin Ave., south to Elder Ave. Since then Bowne Street was extended with Ash, Beach and Cherry Aves. through this estate.\n\nJanuary 1923.\nEugene L.
