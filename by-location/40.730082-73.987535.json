The blunt point of this group of houses (33 & 35 Stuyvesant Street and 126 & 128 E. 10th St.) is probably a few hundred feet from the entrance to St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery; this church for a number of years owned these properties along with a number of others on E. 10th St. and East 11th St. Gift of Lilian Gibbs, 21 May 1960.
