In the foreground, cutting across the cliff, appears what still remains of the old White Plains Road which was the main northbound route along the eastern shore of the Bronx River before the present White Plains Road was laid out sometime after 1900. Still earlier this road was part of the Williamsbridge Road. In the background is Public School 96, at Waring Avenue.\nApril 3, 1938.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
