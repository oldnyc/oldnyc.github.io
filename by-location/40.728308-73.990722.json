The building was erected in 1860 for the Seventh Regiment. A new Armory was erected in 1877-1880 at Park and Lexington Avenues, between 66th and 67th Streets for this organization. Meanwhile the 69th Regiment, organized in 1852, has been meeting here. In the basement are the drill-rooms. On the first floor are markets; on the second floor, ten company rooms and offices; and on the third floor, a drill room. The Abram S. Hewitt Memorial (Cooper Union Annex) building was later erected here; the market being discontinued and the 69th moving to their new Armory on Lexington Avenue between East 25th and 26th Streets.\n\nAbout 1895\n\nGift of Urbrock Collection\n",
