This view shows the Hall Place and East 7th Street side of zone. the building was erected in 1860 for the Seventh Regiment. A new Armory was erected in 1877-1880 between Park and Lexington Avenues, between 66th and 67th Sts for this organization. Meanwhile, the 69th Regiment, organized in 1852, has been meeting here. In the basement are the drill-rooms. On the first floor are markets; on the second floor, ten company-rooms and offices; and on the third floor a drill-room.\nThe Abram S. Hewitt Memorial (Cooper Union Annex) building was later erected here, the market being discontinued and the 69th moving to their new Armory on Lexington Avenue between East 25th and 26th Streets.\n\nAbout 1895\n\nGift of Urbrook Collection",
