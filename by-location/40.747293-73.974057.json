Across the roofs of these structures are buildings in the Grand Central zone; prominent of which are the Chanin, the Commodore Hotel and the Grand Central Building (under construction). To the left of the first mentioned feature is the stack of the Hupfel Brewing Co. Note the lack of the subsequently erected Chrysler Building which if present would obscure the view of the hotel. In the lower foreground is a clearance on the east side of Second Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets and is not to be confused with a similar arrangement between 39th and 40th Street.\n\nSeptember 2, 1928.\n\nP.L.
