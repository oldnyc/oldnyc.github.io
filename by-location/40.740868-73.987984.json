    "text": "Madison Square, looking north across the park from the buildings on 23rd Street just east of Broadway. On Madison Avenue, S.E. corner of 25th Street, the Madison will be demolished between 1910 and 1916 to make room for a 20 story office building. On the N.E. corner of 25th Street is the brand new marble building housing the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, on the S.E. corner of 26th Street the former Lawrence Jerome residence, housing the Manhattan Club. With a little remodelling the buildings in this block will be unchanged in 1935. On the N.W. corner the Madison Square Garden, about ten years old, will be demolished in 1925 to make room for the New York Life building. Most of the buildings along 26th Street on the north side of the Square will give way to office buildings between 1910 and 1916; the Hotel Brunswick on the N.E. corner of Fifth Avenue and 27th Street will go down before 1910. The small new white A.S.P.C.A. building on the N.W. corner of Madison and 26th Street will be standing in 1935. To the left, on Fifth Avenue, may be seen part of the Dewey triumphal arch. A mile to the north, seen across the flat roofs in the center background, is the new Manhattan Hotel on the N.W. corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street. Winter 1899-1900.\n\nBrown Brothers, Photographers.\n",
