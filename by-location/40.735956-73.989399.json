    "text": "34-32-30 Union Square East, at and adjoining the S.E. corner of 16th Street. The corner building was erected around 1877 by the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The branch office of Henry Clews and Company, above the Corn Exchange Bank, mournfully reminds one that the great Bull Market culminated less than a year before the date of this picture.\n\nThe 11-story Reliance Building was erected between 1902 and 1910, on the site of an old 4-story residence which was probably built in the 1850's, when Union Square was the Belgravia of New York. 30, the Freiheit offices, is included in the view of 24-30 Union Square, taken the same day.\n\nUnion Square park, in the foreground, has just been drastically re-modeled.\n\nAugust 4, 1930.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
