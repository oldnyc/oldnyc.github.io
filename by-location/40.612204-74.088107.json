In the center background is the club house on the Fox Hills golf links, formerly the George W. Vanderbilt estate; to its right is the Wrigley chewing gum plant on the Upper New York Bay. In the very foreground is Richmond Road and running diagonally to it, from the lower left hand corner, is Hamilton Street. The inhabited area seen in views 1 and 2 lies between Vanderbilt Avenue and Van Duzer Street, extending east toward the harbor from Richmond Road; the uninhabited area extending to the right from the Fox Hills Golf Club, is the region lying between Vanderbilt Avenue and Fingerboard Road, in the vicinity of Bradys Pond. View 3 is slightly more to the north, towards Stapleton.\n\nP. L. Sperr\nOctober 16, 1926\nViews 1,2,3\n",
