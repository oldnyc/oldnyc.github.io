The site of the old stone meeting house was south west of the present location (then on the north side of Jamaica Ave. between 163rd and 164th Sts.) near the head of Union Hall St. This church and the parsonage were moved to the present location in 1920. In 1814 this edifice was erected near the old site but on the north side of Jamaica Ave. between 163rd and 164th sts., at a cost of 9,51O.74. The cornerstone was laid on June 9th, 1813, by John Richard and the edifice dedicated on Jan. 18,1814. About 1870 the high pulpit and bay pews were removed. The spire of this church rose 102 ft. from the ground. However it was weakened by the September gale of 1821 thereby necessitating the removal of 27 ft. of it. The structure was again enlarged in 1846 and the interior renovated in 1879.\n\n1922\n\nViews 1,2 and 3.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
