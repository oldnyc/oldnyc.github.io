The church as such was organized on June 8, 1862, at Throop Ave., near Hopkins Street. In 1867 it moved to a small frame building at the S.W. corner of Throop and Willoughby Aves. The cornerstone of this building, was laid on November 2, 1889. A part of the wall fell during a storm on January 9, 1890. The edifice was opened for service on November 2, 1890; shortly thereafter it was destroyed by fire. A new site was later acquired at the corner of Throop Ave. and Macon Street.\nOctober 12, 1911.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
