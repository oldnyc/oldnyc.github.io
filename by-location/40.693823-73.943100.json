    "text": "(1)\nThroop Ave., west side, north from, but not including Hart to Willoughby Streets, showing the Throop Ave. Presbyterian Church, which had its origin in a mission established in 1852, on the corner of Throop Ave., and Bartlett Street. The church as such was organized on June 8, 1862, at Throop Ave., near Hopkins Street. In 1867 it moved to a small frame building at the S.W. corner of Throop and Willoughby Aves. The cornerstone of this building, was laid on November 2, 1889. A part of the wall fell during a storm on January 9, 1890. The edifice was opened for service on November 2, 1890; shortly thereafter it was destroyed by fire. A new site was later acquired at the corner of Throop Ave. and Macon Street.\nOctober 12, 1911.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
