    "text": "St. Vincent's Hospital, 153 West 11th Street, at and adjoining N.E. corner of Seventh Avenue, at Mulry Square, seen from 11th Street (formerly Hammond Street) west of Greenwich Avenue. This hospital was founded in 1849 under the patronage of Archbishop Hughes and in charge of his sister, Mother Angela. At that time there were only two other hospitals in New York City (Manhattan and the Bronx). The hospital moved to this site in 1856 or '57, taking over the building of the Catholic Half-Orphan Asylum which stood at 153 West 11th Street. In 1898, after demolition of that building, half of this building was erected on the site. The western half, on the corner of Seventh Avenue, was added in 1905, replacing the old houses 163-5 West 11th Street and 1-5 Seventh Avenue. See Seventh Avenue, also 12th Street, for the other buildings of the hospital.\n\nThe hospital is in charge of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. Mulry Square, where Seventh Avenue begins, at the intersection of 11th Street and Greenwich Avenue, was named after the late Thomas M. Mulry, President of the United States Society of St. Vincent de Paul and President of the Emigrant Savings Bank; he lived nearby, at 10 Perry Street.\n\nMarch 12, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
