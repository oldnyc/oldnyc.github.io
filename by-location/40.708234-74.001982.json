This and other pieces of property on Peck Slip passed to the Roosevelt family in 1755, and from this unit passed to the Scheel family; the present owner being Wm. H. Scheel, importer of varnish gums. No. 9, the adjoining structure housed Ex-Governor Alfred E. Smith during his earlier days. North of the latter is a 3-story frame house, occupied by a junk shop, but formerly, the residence of Dr. Valentine of Valentines Manual fame.\n\nOctober 1937.\n\nGeorge D. Chinn.\n",
