    "text": "Vleigh Place, east side, at 75th Road, showing a farmhouse, owned by Henry Barlow from 1891 to 1909.  It no longer appears in a 1926 atlas of Queens.  When this area was modernized in the late 1930's it appears that Main Street was cut through the site of the house.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection  1923",
