Later it was Klein's Deutschland Park. Reimels, son-in-law of Welz and brother-in-law of Zerwick, operated it at one time. This house was demolished in October 1927. The only houses standing in this view in 1929 are the two displaying awnings, and which are numbered 781-783 Wyckoff Ave. A 5-story brick building now occupies the corner in the foreground.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n\n1922.\n",
