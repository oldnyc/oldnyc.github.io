In the block from 48th to 49th Streets the new Park Lane apartment hotel may be seen under construction, and in the block directly north of it the Railroad Y.M.C.A. building, which is to be demolished in 1929 to make way for the new Waldorf-Astoria. These buildings hid St. Bartholomew's Church, so that the next visible building on the east side is the Hotel Ambassador (1910-20), on the block from 51st to 52nd Streets.\n\nTo the right of the picture may be seen the new American Express Building from 45th to 46th Streets on Lexington Avenue, and behind it the tower of the Hotel Shelton, nearing completion, on the east side of Lexington Avenue from 47th to 48th Streets.\n\nOn the horizon, dimly seen at the extreme right, is the Hell Gate Bridge, shown surprisingly large considering its actual distance.\n\nCompare this with the same scene in 1903.\n\nWinter 1923-4\n\nEwing Galloway, Photographer.\n",
