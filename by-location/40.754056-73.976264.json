The view is roughly southwest from east of the future Park Avenue.\nThe demolition of this old station and the construction of the new one will require a number of years, from about 1907 to 1912. The rear of the old station may be seen against the background of its surroundings in the New York Edison Company's photograph of Park Avenue south from 48th Street, 1903.\n1872\nNew York Edison Company collection",
