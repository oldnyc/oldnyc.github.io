The name Pershing Square, after General Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, was applied to this block about the time of the Armistice.\nThe Pershing Square viaduct, shown here, conducted automobile traffic from Park Avenue and 40th Street across 42nd Street and around the left side of the Grand Central Station to Vanderbilt Avenue and 45th Street. As shown here it is quite new. The covered stairway coming up out of the vacant lot in the foreground is an entrance to the new Lexington Avenue Interborough Subway, opened in the summer of 1918. On the S.W. corner of 4lst Street may be seen part of the old Murray Hill Hotel; and west on 42nd Street the Hotel Manhattan on the N. W. corner of Madison Avenue, later to be remodelled into an office building and uptown office for the National City Bank. The small building on the N. E. corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street is shortly to be demolished and replaced by the Liggett Drug building.\nAbout 1920.\n",
