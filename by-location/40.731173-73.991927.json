At the date of this picture the National Industrial Recovery Act was only five months old and the National Recovery Administration (NRA) had recently been established, headed by General HAugh S.

An NRA parade took place in September of this year (see Parades for phctographs) which was the largest in New Vork 's history, surpassing even the war parades. Later, however, the popularity of NRA waned and early in 1935 it was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the Schechter case, popularly called\nthe \"sick chicken\" case.\nOctober 19, 1933.\n",
