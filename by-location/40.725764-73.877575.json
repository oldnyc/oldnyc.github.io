Walter house of 1873. That would place this house about 1200 ft. west of the above location. However, the writer believes this to be the H. Hettisheimer house of 1893. It is the only house on the whole of Caldwell Avenue that is comparable to the house seen in this view.\n\n1923\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n",
