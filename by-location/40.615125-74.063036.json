By the time it was purchased in 1884 by John Austen, however, several Gothic Revival additions had been made to the original structure. This charming cottage, also known as \"Clear Comfort\", was for many years the home of E. Alice Austen, an accomplished New York photographer at the turn of the century.\n\nBank of New York Calendar 1967-68\n",
