    "text": "(1) Fulton Street, at the N.E. corner of Front Street. The corner site, No. 1 Fulton Street, now 25 Fulton Street, was owned by John Rapelyea who had his home here in 1766. It was purchased in 1784 by Col. J. Sandis who then sold it to Abraham Remsen, who had it demolished. In 1807 Abraham Remsen erected a new building. This property subsequently was owned by the Brooklyn Bank, which in 1868, erected a new building. The Bank occupied this place from 1876 to 1889. This location also has the distinction of housing the first dry-goods store in Brooklyn, conducted by Abraham Remsen. The building adjoining, known as the Law Building, in 1840, had as tenants, Lott, Murphy and J. Vanderbilt; J. Greenwood and Duryea; Morse and Rolfe; William Day and D. Trembly. On the site prior to 1840, Wecks and Backs conducted a hardware store. In 1828 subsequent to the hardware business the building was occupied by Van Nostrand and Tolford's Leather store.\n\n1923.\n\nEugene L.
