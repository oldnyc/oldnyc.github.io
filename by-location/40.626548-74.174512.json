    "text": "Forest Avenue (formerly Washington Avenue), west from about Elizabeth Grove Road. The sign by the roadside reads: What the Brooklyn Bridge has done for Brooklyn, what the Queensboro Bridge has done for Long Island, what the Philadelphia Bridge has done for Camden, the Elizabeth Bridge will do for Washington Manor. The latter refers to the new Goethals Bridge which was later constructed farther down the avenue, linking Elizabeth, N. J. to Old Place, Staten Island.\n\nMarch 3, 1927\n\nP. L. Sperr\n",
