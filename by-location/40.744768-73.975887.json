Previous to the Summer of 1938 these were joined by a spur line, a remnant of a link with the Ferry to Borcen Avenue. Early legislation necessitated same, stating that all transportation facilities join up with either railroad terminals or water facilities. The writer believes the drug store appearing on the left to be place of business from which Col. O'Brien emanated and was fatally attacked during the Draft Riots of 18o3.
