Gill (published 1877) on page 147-8 appears a drawing of this building. It is stated to have been a \"few hundred feet from the corner of 84th St. and St. Nicholas Blvd. (formerly Bloomingdale Road).\" A Mrs. Brennan lived here for 47 years and rented same to Poe in the Spring of 1844. He finished \"The Raven\" in the Winter of that year. In the following Spring he moved to the City proper. It is infered that General Washington and his officers used it as a shelter. G. E.
