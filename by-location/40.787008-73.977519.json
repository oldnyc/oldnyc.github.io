    "text": "Broadway, east side, at West 84th Street, showing the house in which Edgar Allan Poe wrote \"The Raven\". In the \"Life of Poe' by William F. Gill (published 1877) on page 147-8 appears a drawing of this building. It is stated to have been a \"few hundred feet from the corner of 84th St. and St. Nicholas Blvd. (formerly Bloomingdale Road).\" A Mrs. Brennan lived here for 47 years and rented same to Poe in the Spring of 1844. He finished \"The Raven\" in the Winter of that year. In the following Spring he moved to the City proper. It is infered that General Washington and his officers used it as a shelter. G. E. Woodberry in his 'Life of E. A. Poe\" (V. 2 page 113) reports the location as being \"near what is now the eastern corner of 84th Street and Broadway. The sign hanging from the house reads \"John Negel, Mason Builder, Ovens Built & Burners Set, Kalaomining\". The inscript on the rock reads \" R. Hamilton, Upholsterer, 11th Avenue.\n",
