    "text": "Sixth Avenue, east side, between Minetta Street and Minetta Lane, showinm in the open foreground area the site of the garden court, Minetta Place. Extension of the Avenue and related demolition caused this Greenwich Village feature of yore to disappear. Shortly two modern apartment houses will rise here. One to the right and one to the left of the dwellings, the rears of which are in the center. Incidently, these will remain, facing as they do, on Minetta Street. The tenement at the right is on the opposite side of this street.\nAbout 1939\nAlexander Alland, photo\n",
