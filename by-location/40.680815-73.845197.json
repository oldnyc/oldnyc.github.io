At the right of the Hotel, in center of view, is Woodhaven Boulevard, formerly Hopkins Ave., extending northward. Flushing Ave., now 91st Street, cuts diagonally across the right side of this hotel and across Woodhaven Boulevard. The Toll house for this area was at the southern intersection of Liberty Ave. and Rockaway Boulevard in or just east of Vandeveer Ave. However, its site has been absorbed by the widening of the Boulevard. The Centerville Race Course after which this hotel is named was south of the toll house and east of Flushing Ave., now absorbed at this point by the Cross Is. Boulevard. The Centerville Race Course was founded in 1825. In 1860 R.C. McCormick operated the toll gate. The Centerville Hotel seen in these views was operated by Emile Mettetal who was also its proprietor.\n\nAugust 1923.\nView 2: 1894.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
