North of this and facing the Park is the Mayflower Hotel (erected 1921). The twin-towered Century Apartments, shown in view 8, replaced the old Century Theatre, a portion of which appears in the earlier photo. Geographically, Central Park West is Eighth Avenue, an identity it resumes, south of this point, and north of 11th Street.\nMarch 11, 1929\nMarch 19, 1938\nP. L. Sperr\n",
