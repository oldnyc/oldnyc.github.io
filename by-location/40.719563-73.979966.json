Entrance to these houses, is through the halls of the front buildings and across yards 20 feet long. These tenements are only 2 rooms deep and have windows on only one side, allowing meagre light. The yard toilets serve the inhabitants of the entire house during all seasons, and consequentially constitute a health hazard as well as inconvenience to the tenants\n\nNovember 15, 1923.\n\nNew York World.\n",
