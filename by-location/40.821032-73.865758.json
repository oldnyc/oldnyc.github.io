In this house was celebrated the first mass in Westchester County and the committee to design the American flag met here before proceeding to Philadelphia. The land in this area was owned by Lynch in 1793, part of which was sold,in the same year, to Issac Classon, whence the name is derived. In 1870, the mansion was bought by the Brothers of the Christian Schools,(DeLaSalle Christian Brothers) who changed it into the Sacred Heart Academy in 1883. It later became Clasen Point Military Academy.\nJune, 1926\nBrown Brothers\n",
