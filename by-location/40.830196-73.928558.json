The two low frame houses, on the west side of the avenue, adjoining Anderson Ave., bear Nos. 7 and 9. The domed building is Huber's Hotel, at the N.E. corner of East 162nd Street; Jerome Ave. passing the hotel on the left. In the center of the view are shown the rears of 5-story houses, facing on the east side of Anderson Ave. Shown in the foreground is the approach to the Macombs Dam Bridge running through Macombs Dam Park (partially visible). Occupying the west side of Jerome Ave. at this date (1938), is an 8-story apartment house.\nAbout 1913.\nJames Suydam.\n",
