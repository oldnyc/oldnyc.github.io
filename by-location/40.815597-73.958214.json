Old Broadway, a thoroughfare that is not to be confused with Broadway is the street at the left and follows the line of the afore mentioned road. Close scrutiny will show the observer several of the old frame houses still standing and which remain fromm the days when this area\nwas a village, known as Manhattanville.
