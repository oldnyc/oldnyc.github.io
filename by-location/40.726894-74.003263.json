The drug store at the right is 2 Charlton Street, and will be demolished the year after this view, together with the rest of the west side of Macdougal Street from Charlton to Van Dam Streets. No. 34 Macdougal Street, at the S.E. corner of Prince Street, will become 204 Sixth Avenue, No. 32 is the Second Assembly District Republican Club, and No. 28 (future 198 Sixth Avenue), next to the five-story police station, which is flying the flag, is, or used to be, the Richmond Hill settlement house, named after the Richmond Hill mansion which stood in what is now the middle of Charlton Street (q.v.) between Macdougal and Varick Streets. Charlton Street received its present name in 1807, and has so far escaped being made an extension of Prince Street, the way Brannon Street was swallowed by Spring Street, and (later), Hammersley\nby Houston (2.v.).\n1926.\n",
