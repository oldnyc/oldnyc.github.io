    "text": "Vanderbilt Avenue, north from 45th Street, showing the new arcaded hotel between Park and Madison Avenues, from 47th to 48th Streets, not long after its opening. 46th Street appears as a bridge across the Upper Level platforms and tracks.\n\nIn the left foreground, on the N.E. corner of Madison Avenue and 45th Street, is the old Railroad Y.M.C.A. building, temporarily opened from 45th to 47th Streets, and in this block the Hotel Roosevelt will be erected in 1924. On the N.W. corner of Madison Avenue and 46th Street is the Ritz Carlton Hotel, completed in its present form by 1910. The old houses on the east side of Madison Avenue, from 46th to 47th Streets, will presently be demolished. In the left background the tower spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral are seen on the horizon. In the right center, the Possum Building will be built in the block between Vanderbilt and Park Avenues, from 46th to 47th Streets. In the right background may be seen the New York Central Power Plant, east of Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, which will be demolished in 1929 to make room for the new Waldorf Astoria. In the eastern half of this block stands the new Adams Express building. Compare this picture with pictures of this part of Park Avenue at various dates from 1903 to 1925.\n\nAbout 1919.\n\nGift of E. M. Jenks.",
