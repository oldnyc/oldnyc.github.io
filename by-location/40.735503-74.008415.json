There is a small Spanish colony, mostly waterfront people, scattered through this neighborhood; it extends north to 14th Street and east on 14th Street to Seventh Avenue. The dominant element is still Irish, however. There are practically no Italians; this is much too far north and west for stragglers from the Italian colony south of Washington Square.\nJuly 9, 1932.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
