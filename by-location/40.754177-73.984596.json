The flower beds are mostly planted with ivy. The fountain has been moved west from its old position in front of the seated statue of William Cullen Bryant, by Herbert Adams, 1911. For a number of years the only statue in Bryant Park was a bust of Washington Irving, which seems to have disappeared in this latest rearrangement.\nSpring 1935.\nPhoto by Nathan Schwartz\nN.Y.P.
