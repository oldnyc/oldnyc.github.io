    "text": "Broadway, north from a point slightly south of Houston Street, showing vehicular and pedestrian traffic on this main artery of Manhattan during a spectacular period in the Citys history. Note the paved condition of the street bed and the lack of mechanical transportation; gas street lamps appearing midst overhead wire communications. The Grand Central Hotel which became the present Broadway Central Hotel is in the mid-distance with Grace P.E. Church farther northward, at the bend. The structures in the foreground, (both right and left sides) have disappeared today, vacant lots being thereon, caused by demolition work during construction of the Independent Subway. This photograph, made from one of the early dry plates, comes from a book entitled \"How to make photographs\" by T.C. Roche.\n\n1883.\n",
