Prominent in the middle is the 70-story R.C.A. Building. To the left and right respectively are R.K.O. Centre Theatre and the 31-story R.K.O. Building and the International Music Hall. All of these structures front on Sixth Avenue on their far sides, and are viewed westward across Fifth Avenue. The photographer's vantage point is the 40-storied structure, No. 444 Madison Avenue that is to the rear of Saks Fifth Avenue Department Store. At the top appears a glimpse of the North (Hudson) River and its Jersey shore.\n\n1932\n\nGift of Rockefeller Center\nPublicity Department\n",
