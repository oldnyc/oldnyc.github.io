This homestead was founded by James Way who left his estate to his nephew, Samuel Way in the middle of the 18th Century. In 1815, Garret Furman acquired the land. Captain Peter Berton ran a tavern here in July 1783. In 1873 McCrady and Elder operated it as a hotel. Another history concerning this house is that it was erected by the town of Newtown and leased to tavern keepers. It was a resort for the soldiers during the Revolutionary war; later a stage stop, and afterwards a private dwelling. A gas station and tavern occupied the place in 1933.
