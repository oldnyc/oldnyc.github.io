    "text": "Exiting the Henry Hudson Pkwy north at Dyckman Street you are on Riverside Drive with Fort Tryon Park on your right, topped off by the Cloisters.\nThis picture captures the approach to B'way if you intend to go south, & you would make a hard right at the corner. Not bearing right brings you to the intersection of Dyckman St. east or west & B'way going north.\nRemarkably, the streescape is the same today, autos have been updated, store names have been changed, although the Alpine movie theater is no longer in business. The lower stories of the building in the picture with the window awnings are of 103 Thayer St.",
