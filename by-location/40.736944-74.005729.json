They are the NO. 299 N. 12th Street and the NO. 20 Abingdon Square buildings. Between same appears the County Trust Company Building at 14th Street. In the right foreground is the park that identifies this area. This is triangular in shape and is formed by the convergence of Hudson Street and the beginning of 8th Avenue. The bandstand at the right is on Bank Street. Bleecker Street separates this from the clearance shown. In 1939 a modern 6-story apartment house\nwill rise here, bearing an Abingdon Square address.\n\nViews 2 and 3 emphasize the clearance and adjoining structures. Note the absence of the 12th Street building.\n\nViews 1,2: June 18, 1931\nView 3: Marcl 9, 1933\nP. L. Sperr",
