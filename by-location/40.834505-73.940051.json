The car tracks in the foreground are on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\nBetween 161st and 160th Streets may be seen the western end of Sylvan Terrace (formerly Sylvan Place), with its two-story wooden houses, a real estate development of the early 1860's when this part of town was practically suburban.  St. Nicholas Avenue in its present form had been laid out up to this point since around 1870.  North from here it was still Kingsbridge Road.\n\nOn the N.E. corner of 160th Street may be seen the Washington Heights branch of the New York Public Library, 1000 St. Nicholas Avenue.\n\nOctober 12, 1934\n\nP.L.
