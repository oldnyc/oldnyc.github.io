Bainbridge was the owner in 1873 (?) and F. N. Faber in 1891. The Marine Pavilion stood on the west side of Turnpike Road (later Shell Road), south of the junction of Norton Street (now Plainfield Ave.) and Central Ave. (now Beach 20th Street) and occupied most of that block between Plainfield Avenue and Broadway; the ocean coming to the foot of the lawn. This structure, built in 1832-33 was destroyed by fire on June 25, 1864. It stood on the site of the home of Richard Cornell, who came to Far Rockaway in 1685 and died there in 1694. The Rockawav and Jamaica Turnpike Road (Shell Road later and now Beach 19th Street) was constructed in 1834; from Brooklyn to this point, and on this Road stage coaches were regularly run.\n\nJanuary 1923.\nViews 1 & 2.\nView 3: October 1924.\nEugene L.
