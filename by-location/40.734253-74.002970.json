    "text": "4th Street, north from 10th Street (a little to the west of Seventh Avenue South). The car track in the foreground is the west-bound track of the 8th Street crosstown line. This intersection at right angles of two theoretically parallel streets (it also occurs at 4th and 11th and 4th and 12th Streets) is something Greenwich Villagers sometimes take great glee in calling attention to. This part of 4th Street is one of the old Village streets; it was once called William Street, but has been known as Fourth Street since the first quarter of the 19th Century, forming as it does a continuation of the true 4th Street on the East Side. After the Civil War, three of the cross streets, which happened to coincide at Greenwich Avenue with 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets, lost their old names and took these numbers instead. The 5-story apartment house at the N.E. corner of 10th Street (formerly Amos Street) is only a few years old. April 3, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
