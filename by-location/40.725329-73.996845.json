This structure was opened on November 18, 1856 and soon afterward re-christened Laura Keene's New Theatre. This name was attached to half a dozen theatres during the period from 1850 to 1870. She retired in 1863, and John Duff, who then became the manager, re-opened the house as Mrs. John Woods Olympic Theatre. After Mrs. Woods retirement in 1866 it had a checkered career and was demolished in 1880. Joseph Jefferson appeared here in the play \"Our American Cousin\" on its first performance on October 18, 1858.\n\nBetw. 1863-66\n\nGift of Urbrock Collection\n\nPhotostat Neg. No 306\n",
