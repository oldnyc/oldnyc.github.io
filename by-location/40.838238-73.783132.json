    "text": "City Island Ave. (City Island), north from Belden Street, showing the Horton Homestead, bearing No. 26, at the N.E. corner of Belden Street. The house was turned around in about 1908 when the avenue was widened so that the front of the house faces on the avenue and is on a level with it; the stairs having been eliminated. It is about one hundred and fifty years old and is the oldest on the island. At this writing (1937) there are two 1-story frame wings added to it, and together comprise the Duryea Restaurant, named after its present owner.\n1906.\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
