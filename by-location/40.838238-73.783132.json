The house was turned around in about 1908 when the avenue was widened so that the front of the house faces on the avenue and is on a level with it; the stairs having been eliminated. It is about one hundred and fifty years old and is the oldest on the island. At this writing (1937) there are two 1-story frame wings added to it, and together comprise the Duryea Restaurant, named after its present owner.\n1906.\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
