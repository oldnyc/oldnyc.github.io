The building was remodelled by South Church; it was probably at that time that the pointed steeple, which used to surmount the tower, was taken off. The property is being offered for sale; a syndicate will think of an apartment house, but later throw the property back on the church's hands. In 1917 August Heckscher will buy the property, and finally in 1922 it will pass into the hands of William H. Silk, who will erect on the site the Fraternity Clubs Allerton House, 18-story apartment hotel.\nAbout 1912.\n\nUnderwood & Underwood, Photographers.\n",
