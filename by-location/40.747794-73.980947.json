This church, built for the Liberal Presbyterian denomination, was dedicated in 1865, and stood here until demolition(about 1891. The site was then occupied by three small residences, Nos. 26, 28, and 32 Park Avenue. The corner house No. 20, will later be occupied by the Women's City Club and in 1939 will be replaced with a modern apartment house. Note the fence around the center parks; it is probably the original fence of the 1860s and will remain as it is till 1923. To the left, on Madison Avenue appears the steeple-less Church of the Incarnation.\n",
