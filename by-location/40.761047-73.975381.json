Muhlenberg, the rector of the Church of the Holy Communion. He began this work in 1846 and in 1850 raised a subscription of $100,000. A corporation was formed and in 1854 opened an infirmary in a Sixth Avenue house to be conducted by the Sisters of the Holy Communion. In 1888 a Training School for Nurses was established. In 1892, the Trustees purchased a tract on W. 113th Street, near the (then) proposed Cathedral of St. John and erected a new hospital. This site in 1939 is occupied by the 9 story University Club.\n\nThis view shows, a vacant lot at the S. W. corner of this point, at the left of which stood for years the Rockefeller residence.
