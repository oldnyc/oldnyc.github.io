Both are frame houses, but No. 307-305 is faced with brick. No. 309 is the old Ryder house on Herring Street, in which Thomas Paine lived (see Wurts Brothers' 1914 view of it). Herring Street is the third morphologically distinct section of Bleecker Street, from Hancock (later Sixth Avenue Extension) to Christopher Streets. It lost its own name in 1829. No. 307 will be replaced by a new building prior to 1932, and No. 309 not long after.\n\nJune, 1925.\n",

Prior to this, (1874 to 1879) this authority gives no listing. That quaint volume, Doggett's \"New York City Directory\" of 1851 refers to this site by listing No's. 41 and 43 as being vacant, and 45 occupied by one, A. B. Haxturn.\n\nP. L.
