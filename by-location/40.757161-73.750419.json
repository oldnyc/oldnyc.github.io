According to Mr. Armbruster, the mansion, situated on a large estate, was owned by F.N. Lawrence in 1860 and by W.H. Sanger in 1873. Beers's 1873 map also shows it as the Sanger property, just below the Boyce farm on Oakland Lake (Douglas Pond).\n\nThe estate, known as \"The Oaks,\" was opened by a member of the Hicks family and afterwards owned by Lawrence and later by John Henderson and John Taylor. In 1891 it was owned by John Taylor (Wolverton's map) and then comprised 263.25 acres. It was the F.H. Taylor property in 1909. The distant views were most likely taken from Horace Harding Boulevard, formerly West Alley, which marked the southern limit of the estate. The Horatio Parkway location marks the site of the mansion proper, were it standing when the new thoroughfares were laid out.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n1924\nViews 1,2,3\n",
