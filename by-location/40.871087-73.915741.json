Sperr.\n\nThe New York Sun of October 31, 1938, carries an article on the real estate page (No. 35) reporting the demolition of this eighty year old mansion and the sale of the entire block bounded by Park Terrace East and Park Terrace West, W. 215th and 217th Streets. This plot contains more than 118,000 square feet and will be improved by a group of garden apartments designed by Albert Goldhammer and built by a group headed by David Rose. Mr. Thomas Dwyer, a prominent contractor, occupied the mansion for more than a quarter of a century. His family were the sellers.\n",
