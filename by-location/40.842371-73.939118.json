    "text": "1200 St. Nicholas Avenue (formerly Eleventh Avenue) at N.E. corner of 170th Street, showing a new apartment building nearly ready for occupancy.\n\nSt. Nicholas Avenue, north from this point, is the old Eleventh Avenue and was known as such until around 1910. Historically it has nothing in common with St. Nicholas Avenue below Broadway and 169th Street, which was laid out more or less along the lines of old Harlem  Lane (110th to 123rd Streets) and Kingsbridge Road (127th to 139th Streets and 148th to 169th Streets).\n\nSeptember 1921.\n\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n",
