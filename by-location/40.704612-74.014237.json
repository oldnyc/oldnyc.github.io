Harper, 1900.\n\nThese houses on the south side of Bowling Green were built c. 1820. Stephen Whitney, inventor of the otton gin lived in the second house from Broadway.  Peter Remsen, John Guion, David Austin, Elisha Riggs and Ferdinand Suydam lived there, too. Commodore Vanderbilt lived in the house at the State Street corner.\n\nIn the late 1860's, Cunard Line moved its offices into one of these houses, followed by all other foreign steamship companies \u2014 White Star, Anchor, Inman, Guion, Transatlantique, Holland and others.  It became known as 'Steamship Row.' Today it is the site of the Custom House.\n",
