    "text": "State Street, east side, south from Bowling Green Row to Pearl Street, showing a row of fashionable homes facing on Battery Park (right). Shown in the foreground, is No. 7 Bowling Green, at the S.E. corner of State Street. The farthest building shown, is Stewart's Store, (predecessor to John Wanamaker in the Department Store line), which occupied the block between Bridge and Pearl Streets. Stephen Whitney resided in one of the houses facing Bowling Green. Today (1937), the U.S. Custom House rises here on the area shown in the foreground, with the 12-story Battery Park Building (former Stewart site) at its rear. About 1860.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",
