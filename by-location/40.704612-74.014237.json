Peter Remsen, John Guion, David Austin, Elisha Riggs and Ferdinand Suydam lived there, too. Commodore Vanderbilt lived in the house at the State Street corner.\n\nIn the late 1860's, Cunard Line moved its offices into one of these houses, followed by all other foreign steamship companies \u2014 White Star, Anchor, Inman, Guion, Transatlantique, Holland and others.
