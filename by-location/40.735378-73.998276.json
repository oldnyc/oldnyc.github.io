The Rhinelander Gardens, 112-124, on the south side are set back from the street so that only front of the yards, with their ailanthus trees, is visible here.  The Unadilla aprtment house beyond them (126-128) was erected around 1900 on the site of two old three-story houses.  125 West 11th Street, on the north side, used to be the residence of Daniel Chester French, the sculptor.  133 West 11th Street, the six-story apartment building on the north side, is known as the Elmendorf, but was originally called the Moffatt; it is contemporary with Unadilla, and was erected on the site previously occupied by the Third Universalist Church.  No.137-139 and some of the other houses beyond them are occupied by male student nurses.  St. Vincent's Hospital, the part of it rebuilt in 1898 and 1905, occupies the rest of the north side to Seventh Avenue.  In the Background is 201 West 11th Street, a fairly new apartment building on the N.W. corner of Greenwich Avenue.  Here 11th Street ends and that portion which was once Hammond Street, and which runs southwest instead of west to the Hudson River, begins.  Up to about 1880, 11 Street was numbered west from Broadway.  In the block from Sixth to Seventh Avenues, 36 should be added to the present house numbers to convert them to the old numbers.\nMarch 6, 1933\nF.L. Sperr",
