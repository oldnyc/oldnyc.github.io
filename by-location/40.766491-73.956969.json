Abraham Cohen, PHD was the Principal from 1923 to 1940 followed by Miss Novy as Principal from 1940 until the building was demolished in the 1960s to make way for a Public Housing building. Just North of PS 82 was the \"Lenox Hill Settlement House\". \"Lenox Hill\" had two Gymnasiums large and small, an Olympic swimming pool, woodworking shop, meeting rooms and contained a large auditorium with a stage. That space became \"The Neighborhood Playhouse\" from which many actors were trained. I was a student at P.S. 82 Manhattan from 1946 to 1952.",
