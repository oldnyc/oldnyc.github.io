Note the ships leaving and entering the North (Hudson) River. This is on the right and flows outward towards the Statue of Liberty, the State of New Jersey forming its other side. The buildings in the foreground are at the southerly tip of Manhattan and constitute a part of the business and financial district. The City Bank-Farmers Trust Tower, at the left, overshadows the rectangular Produce Exchange and the U. S. Custom House. To the right is the Standard Oil structure.\n\nFebruary 3, 1934\nViews 1 and 2\n\nP. L. Sperr\n",
