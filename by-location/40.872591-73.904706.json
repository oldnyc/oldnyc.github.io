    "text": "W. Kingsbridge Road, south from Heath Avenue, up \"Breakneck Hill\" toward Sedgwick Avenue. Mr. Randall Comfort, historian of the Bronx, states that it is an old lane at Kingsbridge, which was part of a colonial highway that led up from Spuyten Duyvil Creek across the steep \"Breakneck Hill\" to Fordham and West Farms. It follows the course of the old King's Bridge Road which led from Manhattan over King's Bridge (now 230th Street at Kingsbridge Avenue), and another branch of which led over Farmer's Bridge (now W. Kingsbridge Road, directly west of Exterior Street) across the entire breadth of the Bronx, through Fordham and West Farms, then across the Bronx River at E. 180th Street, into Westchester County. King's Bridge Road, in older times, was the Boston Post Road, and it is possible that this is part of the road along which Mrs. Knight, mentioned in Wells's history of the Bronx (p. 315), traveled.\n\n1906.\n\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
