It runs parallel to West 230th Street, the distance of one block from the foot of Corlear Ave. to the foot of Tibbet Ave. (where automobile house is located). The freight house is at this date (1937) being used by the Mayone Co. of New York, mason suppliers; a new, large and modern freight station having been constructed within the freight yards east of Corlear Ave. The driveway is about 15 feet south of West 230th Street and is separated by a fence.\n\nOctober 27, 1927.\n\nP.
