The commercial structures there flank both sides of this thorough- fare below West Houston Street. Varick Street changes its identity above the bend to become Seventh Avenue. At the right is Sixth Avenue's extension under construction. Note the old \"El\" line on same above W. 3rd Street. The clearly defined thoroughfare at the left is Hudson Street. Eighth Avenue branches off of the latter in the upper left corner. Tortuous Greenwich Street and its nearly parallel Washington Street are closer to the left margin.\n\nEwing Galloway\n\n1928\n",
