When the present multi-story building No. 1 Park Avenue was erected, this Avenue was extended southward to begin at 32nd Street. In the renumbering, this office building took the number formerly held by Mrs. Bacon at the N. E. corner of Park Avenue and E. 34th Street.\n\nBehind the board fence in the foreground ran the trains to Harlem, thru the tunnel to Grand Central Station at 42nd Street. It was here that the famous Tunnel Gang originated and from which came Boss Crocker of Tammany, a worthy successor to Boss Tweed.\n\nIn earlier days this was the bed of Sunfish Pond. The ground slope clearly seen here indicates the size and depth of same.\n\nRemaining today (1939) are only two of the buildings appearing here. They are the 4 story structure seen at the left margin and the St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church at the right. No. 197 Lexington Avenue, the first mentioned, is now an automobile garage.\n\n1860's\n",
