It was commanded by Admiral Lessosfky who came with decks cleared for action in case guns could render service to Lincoln and his ideals. His arrival reassured Mayor Opdyke and other Gothamites, as at this time the country was apprehensive of a conflict with England.\n\nThis is a set of 2 views; showing in No. 1 the Fleet at anchor in New York Harbor and in No. 2 the armed contingents marching northward past Union Square. Note in the latter, the equestrian statue of Washington, which in this view stands in a circle at Union Square East and 14th Street. In the background of same, and appearing prominently, is the Everett House.\n\nThis fleet visited Boston at a later date, for an account of which, see Biography, A p.v. 26; Lessosfky Banquet.\n\nThe New York Herald Tribune of October 23, 1937, on page 15, in an article on a new Alaskan stamp issue refers to this naval visit and shows its relationship to our purchase of that territory.\n\nNovember 1863.\n\nGift of H.
