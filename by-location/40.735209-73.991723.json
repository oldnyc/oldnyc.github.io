    "text": "Union Square, seen from the S.W. corner at University Place and 14th Street.  Henry K. Browne's statue of Lincoln, erected by popular subscription in 1868, stands in the left foreground, facing away from the camera.  Bartholdi's Lafayette, erected in 1876 by the French residents of the city, is visible in the extreme right of the picture.  Behind it may be seen the old Union Square Hotel on the S.E. corner of Union Square East (Fourth Avenue) and 15th Street, built in the late 1870's.\nUnion Square, a broad common where Fourth Avenue, the old Bowery Road, and other streets converged, was like Washington Square, once used as a Potter's Field.  In 1845 it was made into a park, and was soon surrounded by fine mansions, remaining the Belgravia of New York up to the time of the Civil War.  At the time of this picture, the fashionable shopping district was located here and north to Madison Square.\nOn the N.W. corner of Fourth Avenue and 17th Street stands the Everett House, a famous old hotel named after the orator Edward Everett.  Behind it is a 9-story wing very recently added, on the corner of 16th Street; it will later become the Bradley Building, even before the Everett is torn down.  Adjoining the Everett, to the left of the picture, is a new 6-story office building.  The Westmoreland apartment house, on the S.E. corner of 17th Street and Union Square East, is the building in which William Lloyd Garrison died.\nCompare this with the same view in January, 1928, New York Edison photo No. 60533\n\n1893\nNew York Edison Company Collection\n",

    "text": "Union Square West, north from East 14th Street, showing the Lincoln statue silhouetted against the buildings that face Union Square. This thoroughfare in reality is a part of Broadway. It\u2019s true identity is lost in that 14th to 17th Street gap that sweeps past the Park. The street cars of the same curved eastward in a serpentine loop forming the well known \"Death Curve\".\n\nThe martyr President stands in the attitude of addressing an audience, and the angularity and ungracefulness of his figure are expressed with painful exactitude. A low curb of granite surrounds the pedestal, and on this are inscribed the famous Gettysburg words, \"With malice toward none, With charity for all\".\n\nThis is the work of Henry K. Browne and was paid for by popular subscription. It was erected in 1868 and complements the nearby equestrian Washington statue.\nAt the left margin is the 5 story building occupied for years by Tiffany & Company. Opposite is a lower structure with the well known Sol Young, Photographer, as a tenant. These are at East 15th Street. The dominant office building is the 17 story Bank of the Metropolis Bldg., No 31 Union Square West. Broadway reasserts itself in the center background. To the right are buildings that face on the north side of East 17th Street, extending toward Fourth Avenue.\n\nGeorge L. Balgue\n\nFebruary, 1906\n",

Most of the new buildings shown here were erected between 1902 and 1910. The new Union Square Savings Bank is on the N.E. corner of 15th Street, and the 11-story Reliance Building at 32 Union Square, adjoins the old building now occupied by the Freiheit, a radical Yiddish paper. To the same period belong the Everett Building on the N.W. corner of 17th Street and Fourth Avenue, and the Guardian Life Insurance building (originally Germania Life Insurance) on the N.E. corner. On the street floor of the old Union Square Hotel may be seen one of the signs of S. Klein's dress emporium. In 1930 The Daily Worker, organ of the Communist Party, will be occupying the old building next to the Freiheit, where Elite Styles are shown in this picture; and by 1933 S. Klein will have overflowed into both these buildings. The principal change during these years, however, will be the demolition of the old Westmoreland at 17th Street and of 44 Union Square adjoining, to make room for the new Tammany Hall and Manufacturers Trust Building, and the drastic changes in the park, which in this picture still has much the same general outlines as it had thirty-five years earlier.\n\nJanuary 11, 1928.\n\nNew York Edison Company Collection, (No. 60533).\n",

It is on a part of the old Brevoort farm of 22 acres that Elias Brevoort sold about 1758 to John Smith and whose heirs four years later sold to Henry Springler.  The demolished building was originally a private dwelling and became a hotel after the Springler House of No. 5 Union Square burned down in the 1870's.  It was a favorite rendezvous for actors playing at the old Academy of Music, Tony Pastors, the Union Square and other theaters of the vicinity.  Tradition has it that well known Thespians lived here and that the \"Lambs\" had their inception here, tho that organization has no record of having formally used these rooms.
