On the left is the Randall Memorial Church in the style of the late Italian Renaissance. To its right is the Music Hall. The building on the right, with the low dome, is the Main Building, used for administrative purposes. Sailors' Snug Harbor, a home for retired seaman, was founded in 1801 by the will of Captain Robert Richard Randall, son of a privateer, who bequeathed the bulk of his fortune for the establishment and support of an institution for destitute sailors. The site was purchased in 1831 and the asylum was opened in 1833. The Harbor contains more than fifty buildings.\nAbout 1900\nPhoto by August Loeffler\nFrom P.L. Sperr Collection",
