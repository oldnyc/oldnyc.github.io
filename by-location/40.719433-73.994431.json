Clarence Davies Collection, Museum of the City of New York. Negative No. 584.\n\nThe New York Times of May 26, 1939 reports the sale of this and it's adjoining structure (No's. 138-140). John \"Callahan the Hatter\" occupied No. 138 and attracted the patronage of many of the beaux and dandies of the \"Gay Nineties\". At his death, the business was continued by his clerks. Recently the store was divided and occupied by crockery and novelty dealers. No. 138 is a leased branch of the National Cash Register Company.\n",
