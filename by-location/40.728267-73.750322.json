Some of this land was owned by Wheeler Brothers in 1909 and the area was known as Inglewood. Running south from the lower left hand corner of the photograph is 215th Place, commencing at Spencer Avenue and crossing Hillside Avenue where the two-story brick buildings are. View 2 is in a more easterly direction. The dirt road is Spencer Avenue.\n\nP. L. Sperr\nMarch 4, 1927\nViews 1,2\n",
