The inscription reads: Erected to the Memory of an Amiable Child St. Claire Pollock Died 15 July 1797 in the Fifth Year of His Age.\n\nGeo. L. Balgue 1928 \n\nThe following text is taken from a photograph of Clermont Inn \"Riverside Park S - Tiemann Place (W.127 St.)\" 973/C2\n\nRiverside park, south from Tiemann Place, (West 127th Street), showing the Clermont Inn on Riverside Drive. This structure was built before the Revolution, on land, sold August 4, 1796, by Nicholas de Peyster to George Pollock, a linen merchant who named the place for its beautiful trees and shrubbery, \"Strawberry Hill.\" His 5 year old son, St. Claire Pollock, fell off the cliffs and was drowned July 15, 1797. His father subsequently went to New Orleans, where his descendants there, are said to be called Polk. His land, expressly reserving the burial place containing the urn of his boy, which may still be seen near Grant's Tomb, was sold in 1803 to Joseph Alston, the husband of medicosia Burr, who deeded it to Michael Hogan, the former British Consul at Havana. The latter named the place \"Clermont\" after the residence of the Earl of Clermont, Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV. The Earl of Devon, who resided here in 1807, was himself a cousin to Fulton\u2019s \"Clermont\", and in 1815 an occupant was Joseph Bonaparte, the ex-King of Spain. The family bought the property, and since 1872 it has been a famous public restaurant. The land to the east and south of same is historical, being the scene of several of the sharpest engagements of the Battle of Harlem Heights on September 16, 1776.\n\nAbout 1907.\n\nWurts Brothers.\n",
