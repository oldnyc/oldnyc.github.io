    "text": "Hawtree Creek Road, at 130th Street, looking southwestward and showing the sharp bend in the road. On the left is part of the W. Jellinghans farmhouse (1860), later the D. Van Sicklen property. Sections of Hawtree Creek Road became incorporated in the modern streets later laid out. The portion of the road in the immediate foreground, just before the bend, is now (1942) 109th Avenue. The remainder of the thoroughfare below the bend is still called Hawtree Creek Road.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n1922\n",
