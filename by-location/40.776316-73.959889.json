The clearance seen, was caused by the demolition of two 5-story structures (Nos. 933 and 935) and upon which will rise a 12-story building. Partially shown on the right is a 14-story corner structure that was erected in 1907 and is said to be the first apartment building of over 6-stories on Park Ave. According to the New York Times of December 5, 1937 this structure has been completely modernized with the exclusion of 1 apartment, which has been occupied\nby the same tenant for 30 years.\n1922.\nCollins.\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n",
