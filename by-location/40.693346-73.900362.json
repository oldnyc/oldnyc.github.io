This place was known as \"The Little Pink House.\" Norman Van Nostrand came here from New York City. He settled on forty acres of land and erected this house thereon in 1852. This house which was demolished in 1910 was also known because the feast church services of the St. Thomas Episcopal Church (located on Bushwick Ave. and Cooper Street, Kings County) were held here during the winter of 1871.\n\nEugene L.
