    "text": "Pearl Street, at the N.E. corner of Willoughby Street. The corner building was the Fifth Presbyterian Church, also known as the Central Presbyterian Church. It was erected in 1838 by Samuel A. Willoughby at his expense and dedicated May 30, 1839. (The congregation was transferred by a Rev. Abraham Peters D.D. and later dispersed; a new church was then organized in November 1840). In 1841 Jos. Hegeman, a merchant established his auction rooms in this building and remained until 1864. The steeple was taken down and the building stuccoed in 1924. It was demolished in 1928.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
