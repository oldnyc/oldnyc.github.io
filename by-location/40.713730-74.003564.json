This open area, the Collect Pond site, has not as yet been improved because of shifting sands. Engineering advances will enable this danger to be avoided. Incidentally this was the scene of the first work relief program in New York; the Pond being filled in by men that were thrown out of work by the embargo declared by President Jefferson in 1812.
