    "text": "Washington Ave., east side, between East 189th Street and East Fordham Road, showing the Powel Farm House, considered to be the oldest house in Fordham. Randall Comfort designates the location as East Fordham Road and Washington Ave., which corresponds with the location given in Kelley's Historical Guide to New York. The above location is within the William Powel estate according to E. Robinson's map of 1885. However, the Newell S. Brown map of Westchester County of 1851 shows a Powel house at what is now (1937) the N.E. corner of Lorillard Place and Third Ave. (4434-4436 Third Ave). The site of the Powel House is now occupied by the Theodore Roosevelt High School.\n\n1905.\n\nGift of Randall Comfort.\n",
