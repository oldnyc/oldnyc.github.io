At the right may be seen 3 Leroy Street and part of No. 1, the frame houses at the north corner. No. 7, the little house with dormer windows, is also of frame, but faced with brick.\nBurton Street kept its own name until nearly 1850, when Leroy Street was extended east through the old Trinity Cemetery on Hudson Street to meet the western end of Burton Street. The new Leroy Street was then numbered west from this end. See also St. Luke's Place.\nMay 1, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
