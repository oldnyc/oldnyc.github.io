    "text": "Exterior (Marginal) Street, north from East 21st Street, showing the waterfront thoroughfare that skirts the East River, and which will be incorporated into the new East River Drive. Extending to 24th Street, it will be continued on filled ground to sweep pass the institutional Bellevue Hospital buildings. Busses seen in the center are at the foot of 23rd Street. The old Greenpoint Ferry that was there for years has been removed. Towering above the gas station that occupies the 22nd to 23rd Street frontage, is the J. J. Little & Ives bookbinding plant. At the left is the massive Empire State Building. In the background appear the skyscrapers that compose the Grand Central-42nd Street outline. The New York Steam Co. plant is on the right, this side of the Tudor City buildings.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nJuly 18, 1939\n",
