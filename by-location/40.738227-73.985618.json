In the foreground appears Gramercy Park South; on the left, low buildings on Gramercy Park West, and in the right background, a view north of Lexington Ave. from its starting point at Gramercy Park North. Note also (left background) the tower of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Building. The name of Gramercy Park is said to be derived from Krom Moerasje (Crooked Little Swamp) formed by Cedar Creek, which formerly flowed from Madison Square to the East River. The present park once formed part of a large farm acquired in 1761 by James Duane, once Mayor of New York City and by him christened \"Gramercy Seat\". It is an exclusive park, not open to the public; in the center of which appears a statue of Edwin Booth in the role of Prince Hamlet. About 1932.\n\nEwing Galloway.\n",
