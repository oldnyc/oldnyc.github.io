The small white building (No. 20) on the extreme left is the 4th Precinct Police Station and is at the S.W. corner of Varick Street. Shown on the right is an extensive view southward on Hudson Street from Light Street. John Ericsson, the inventor and builder of the famous war-vessel \"Monitor\" resided at one time at what was No. 30 Beach Street and in his honor this portion which contained his house has been named Ericsson Place. The site would be in the center, directly in front of the chimney tower shown.\n\nMay 20, 1937.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
