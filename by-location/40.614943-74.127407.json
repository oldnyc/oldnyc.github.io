Shown is an old farmstead before Westcott Boulevard was laid out on the site of the pond (Mr. Sperr refers to it as Lust's Pond), the view being in a southerly direction and marking the direction in which Westcott Boulevard runs. Butler's 1853 map shows this to be on the P. Laforge property; Beers's 1874 mip indicates the h use to have been the mining captain's residence of the Richmond Iron Mining Comnany. whose iron mines were nearby. In 1898 and 1907 it was part of the J.W. Cochrane property and the pond was known as \"Diamond Lake.\" Kemball, Chandler and Coale Avenues now (1940) cut across the site from east to west.
