The photographer shows at the N.E. corner of 40th Street, the 27 storied Central National Bank Building occupying the site of the former Holland Building. Under demolition is the Broadway Theatre, which occupied the frontage on the south side of 41st Street, extending from Seventh Avenue (foreground) to Broadway. Its main entrance was upon the latter. Here was erected the 33 storied structure known as 1441 Broadway. Subsequently the Continental Hotel (with billboard sign atop thereof) and the 3 story adjacent structure were razed for the site of the present 40 storied, No. 1450 Broadway Building. Indistinctly in the left background appears the vague outline of the 10 E. 40th Street Building.\n\nP.L. Sperr\nFebruary 5, 1929.\n",
