Actual work was begun in January, 1870 and it was completed in May, 1884, having been opened in the previous year. Its overall length is 1 1/4 miles, width 85 feet, with a central span across the East River, 1595 feet long and 135 feet above high water mark. John A. Roebling, who drew up the specifications and began construction was succeeded upon his death by his son, Washington A. Roebling.
