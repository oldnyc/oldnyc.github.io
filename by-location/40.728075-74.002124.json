A branch of the municipal subway is under construction under Houston Street itself and under the site of the houses which used to be on the south side. This picture shows an intermediate stage of construction by the \"cut-and-cover\" method. This branch will not be opened till 1936. This view shows almost all of the original Houston Street. The dark building in the background is 604-608 Broadway, where Houston Street met the western end of North Street (now East Houston Street). East Houston Street does not make a right angle with Broadway, but bends a little north.\n\nJune 15, 1930.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
