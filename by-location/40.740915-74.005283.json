The low three-story building opposite the northern end of Washington Street is the Gillen Building (between 1910 and 1916). Most of the taller buildings date from 1903 or later.  The eight-story building near Tenth Avenue, on the north side, was originally build for the American Can Company but has since been taken over by National Biscuit.\n\nPiers 53 to 61, from Little West 12th Street to 21st Street, were built between 1902 and 1910 on the side of the old made-land waterfront.  Before that time, 14th Street extended west to the southern end of old Eleventh Avenue, which was as far west of Tenth Avenue as Tenth is west of Ninth.\n\nApril 10, 1931.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
