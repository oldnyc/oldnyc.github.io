These stores do a brisk trade among alien and native stocks alike, all seeking the content and not the cover.  Several of the enterprises conduct auctions and issue mimeographed catalogues which are widely circulated.  These in performing their function are responsible for the wide variety of attending buyers; bibliophile and student alike being represented.  The outside counters in serving a different public, are utilzed by those passing by or employed in the vicinity.  June 12, 1933\n\nP.L. Sperr",
