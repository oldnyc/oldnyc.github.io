    "text": "EXCLUSIVE\n9708\n\nA LESSON FOR \"DEFENSE DAY\" IN A N.Y. FORT.\n\nThe scene depicted above might well happen with the inadequate system of defense against attack from an enemy. The photo shows one of the great 12\" inch rifles in Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, in action against enemy ships beyond Sandy Hook. Other enemy ships have landed troops and tanks below the fortifications. Whippet tanks make a concerted against the unprotected rear and one climbing the parapet in front, fires with its one pounder on the unprotected gun crew and the few infantrymen with a machine gun and rifles. An adequate system of mobilization with the necessary equipment to prevent such an incident as this is one of the purposes of \"Defense Day.\"\n\nYOUR CREDIT LINE MUST READ: - (BY UNITED)\nSept. 13, 1924.\n\nThis photo is supplied by\nUnited Newspictures, Inc.\n",
