    "text": "Foley Square, easterly side, north from Duane, across Pearl, to Worth Streets, showing respectively, The Federal Courts Bldg., the New York County Court House and the New York State Bldg. all facing on what technically is Centre Street.\nViews 2 and 3 emphasize the New York County Court House and are viewed eastward from Elm Street (the westerly boundary of the square) which in its self is really a continuation of Lafayette Street.\nAll of these structures are built upon and around what in early days was Collect Pond and where in 1796, John Fitch tried his new steamboat under the observation of Chancellor Livingston and other prominent New Yorkers. Where Centre and Leonard Streets intersect today it had a depth of 60 feet. During the English and French conflict, President Jefferson (1807) ordered an embargo on all shipping and New York suffered. To alleviate same, individuals were set to work to fill in this pond and morass and thereby set a precedent for public work relief. A drainage canal was cut thru in 1809 which later became Canal Street.\nPropositions for the use of the area as a Park were introduced as early as 1789, though naught came of them and it remained a dreary vacant area awaiting modern scientific engineering. Their main difficulty was not water but quicksand and most of these buildings have what is called a floating foundation.\nJune 12, 1938.\nViews 1,2 and 3\nP. L. Sperr\n",
