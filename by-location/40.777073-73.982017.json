    "text": "Broadway, west side, from 70th to 71st Streets. In the center is the older wing of the Sherman Square Hotel. The buildings at the left will later be demolished and a new twelve-story wing added to the hotel, so that it covers the entire block. The two-story building with the \"Plumbing\" sign is an old frame structure. At the extreme right is Christ Church (Protestant Episcopal). In the foreground, men have just started to break ground in the construction of New York's first subway.\nMarch 19, 1901.\nWilliam B. Parsons Collection.\nNeg ~~ io8S\n",
