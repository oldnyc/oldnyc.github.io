There are quite a number of law offices and bail bond firms in this block of 10th Street, the Jefferson Market Magistrates' Court being on the south side at the corner of Sixth Avenue. The clearing where the camera man is standing is the site on which the new House of Detention for Women is being constructed.\n\nThe name Amos Street was dropped about the time of the Civil War, inasmuch as the eastern end of Amos Street met the western end of 10th Street at this point.\n\nJune 15, 1930.\n\nP.
