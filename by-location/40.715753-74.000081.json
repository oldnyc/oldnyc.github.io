    "text": "Foley Square, northward, from the Municipal Building, showing this civic center prior to improvement. Thru the center runs Centre Street (cartracks). On the left and right respectively are Lafayette and Park Streets. The solitary one story clinical (narcotic addictions) faces on Worth Street. Columbus Park is in the right background. This open area, the Collect Pond site, has not as yet been improved because of shifting sands. Engineering advances will enable this danger to be avoided. Incidentally this was the scene of the first work relief program in New York; the Pond being filled in by men that were thrown out of work by the embargo declared by President Jefferson in 1812. He, fearing naval complications with Great Britain closed the port.\n\nGift of E. M. Jenks\n\n1916-7\n",
