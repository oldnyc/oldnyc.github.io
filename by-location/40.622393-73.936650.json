    "text": "Kings Highway, at the N.W. corner of Flatbush Ave. It is said that the land on which this house stands, was sold by Elbert Elbertsen in 1676 to Peter Wyckoff. Iw 1797 Simon Voorhies cemwe into possession of it, and used it as a tavern. John B. Durges owned it until 1820, used it as a tavern for about 20 years. Abraham Torhune became the next owner and his estate sold it in 1843 to John Bergen who built a 2-story extension on the west side, the first floor becoming a ballroom and the second floor sleeping quarters. In 1855 John Logue became the owner. William R. Mc Neil became the owner in 1860 and in 1874 John Van Wyck bought the property and lived in it until 1882. Letween 1882 and 1895 the place became an ice cream parlor and saloon, and from 1895 to 1902 the Amersfort Hotel was kept here. In 1902 the property reverted to the heirs of John Van Wyck and was demolished in 1923.\n1922.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
