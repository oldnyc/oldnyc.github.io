Shulte store was formerly part of Altman's Department Store. This bears No. 615-9 Sixth Avenue and is at the N.W. corner of W. 18th Street.  The store covered the entire block front from 18th to 19th Streets.  The New York Times of March 7, 1939 reports the 1st transfer of this holding since 1817 when it was acquired as farmlands by John Tonnele. He left it in trust for John L. Tonnele who died at the age of 86 years and the tract passed in 1918 to the present sellers.\nIn making the title search, numerous difficulties arouse because of the inaccurate definitions of boundaries when streets were originally put through, encroachments due to faulty surveys, etc. necessitating a large amount of negotiation finally to clear up the fee.\nThe Astor interests own the balance of the block front and the combined holdings were divided into two units, of which the southerly portion has now been sold.\nMarch 29, 1939\nR.L.
