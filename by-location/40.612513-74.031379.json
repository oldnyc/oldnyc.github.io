The church was organized in this community in the farmhouse of a Denyse, at the N.E. corner of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 101st Street, on September 29, 1834. The Denyse heirs reserved a lot (100' x 125') the present site, on which a frame building was erected. It was consecrated on July 16, 1835. On Dec. 24, 1890 this building was partly burned, resulting in its demolition and the erecting of the present one in 1897, which was consecrated on January 5, 1898.\n\n1922.\n\nEugene L.
