Abraham Kettletas, born in New York in 1732, was a Presbyterian Minister, who came to Jamaica on or about the year 1759. He had no pastorate, but occupied a farm near the site of tcis house. During the Revolution the British took possession of his property and defaced his home. In 1799 there is a probability that the house of the late William Kettletas burned to the ground and that S. Judd erected\nthe present structure.\n1922.\nEucene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
