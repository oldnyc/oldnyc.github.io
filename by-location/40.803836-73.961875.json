This photo shows the apse, or East end, with seven radiating chapels; and the crossing, with its temporary dome.\n\nThe nave, or staff of the cross, which this completed church will form, is the next part to be built. It is also planned to erect a great tower, 500 feet high, above the present, temporary dome.\n\nMarch 10, 1924  Underwood and Underwood\n\nEven in its unfinished condition the Cathedral represents an expenditure of more than $5,000,000 and when completed will have cost four times as much. There will be seats for 7,000 persons. Some of the seven chapels are as commodious as many churches. It is expected that the Cathedral will be completed within ten years.\n\nReview of Reviews\n",
