The remaining two are shown toward the right of the picture.\n\nThe somewhat similar building on 103rd street, in the middle of the block, is not a part of this construction but is the Hotel Alexandria, three or four years older. 254 West 103rd Street remains sandwiched between the two buildings, and two more of these old houses remain between the Alexandria and the old Marseilles Apartment Hotel (around 1905). On the S.W. corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 103rd Street may be seen the Hotel Clendening, originally the old Castle Hotel and Castle Apartments of the late 1890's, and known around 1910 as the Kenesaw apartments.\n\nSee the companion picture to this view, two months later.\n\nMarch 15, 1923\n\nAmerican Photo Service, Inc.\nGift of H.M. Jenks.",
