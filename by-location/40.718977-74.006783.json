    "text": "West Broadway, at the 3. W. corner of Franklin Street (right), viewing across the open area identified as Finn Square, formed at the point of convergence by West Broadway and Varick Street. Ordinarily this location would be a portion of the latter thoroughfare, as it is apparently a continuation. The fact remains that both sides of the Square are classified as being West Broadway. A one story tax-payer (No. 137 Franklin Street) is shown upon the former site of the Fifth Ward Museum. This was operated by an individual named \"Riley\". On exhibition there, included with other incunabula was the statue of William Pitt. The New York Historical Society possesses same\ntoday.\nThe New York Sun published a drawing of the old Hotel building in their series \"Old New York in Pictures\". This was No. 169, titled, 'The Fifth Ward Museum Hotel in 1864'. The large building bearing the various signs is No. 139 Franklin Street, and adjoins the corner.\n",
