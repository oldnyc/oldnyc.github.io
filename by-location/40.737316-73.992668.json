The original buildings were demolished in 1869, and the 15th to 16th Streets buildings opened in 1877. They will be demolished in 1934, when the hospital moves to York Avenue. For further views see 15th Street adjoining N.W. corner of Fifth Avenue.\nThe gray buildings in the background are St. Francis Xavier College and Church.\nAbout 1927.\n\nEwing Galloway.",
