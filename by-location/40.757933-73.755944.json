    "text": "Cloverdale Boulevard, east side, between Northern Boulevard and Horatio Parkway. Eugene L. Armbruster states this to be the Ker Boyce farmhouse and he gives the location as south of the water-works and Northern Boulevard, and north of the Alley. In the Queens Atlas of 1858, this house belonged to one Osgood, who owned some 260 acres. From 1860 to 1873 Ker Boyce was owner and occupant. His house was then south of a small creek which emptied into Alley Creek from Douglas Pond (now Oakland Pond.) At this time a road extended south and connected Northern Boulevard (old Broadway) and West Alley Road. The house was at the S.E. junction of this creek and Road. In 1891 F.W. Lawrence owned the house which up to that time belonged to John Taylor through his marriage to Boyce's daughter. Also for the first time Douglas Pond emptied directly into Little Neck Bay and the Flushing water works were erected on the north side of Northern Boulevard on a canal which was cut through for this purpose. In 1909, G.W. Eicles owned this property. In 1928 the two buildings were located as follows: the house on Cloverdale Boulevard, east side, between Northern and Birmington Parkways and the barn to the south of the last named Street. This is a set of four views.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n\nJune 1924.\n",
