Here Thomas Paine, author of \"The Age of Reason,\" spent most of the last year of his life, although he died in another house on Grove (then Columbia) Street, to which he was moved in April 1809. The house shown here will be taken down in 1932.\n\nIn 1829 Herring Street became part of Bleeker Street, and was renumbered accordingly; the house numbers were again changed around the time of the Civil War. At that time this house, then 293 Bleeker Street, became 309 Bleeker Street.\n\nWurts Brothers\n\nAugust 19, 1914\n",
