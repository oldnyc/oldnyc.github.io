L. Sperr.\n\nThe New York Times of October 18, 1938 states that the buildings at the S.W. corner of 106th Street and the Avenue, consisting of No's. 2047-0 First Avenue and No. 348 E. 106th Street are to be demolished and replace by a gasoline station. They appear in the left center with a canopy extending over the sidewalk. The interesting feature in this real estate deal was the straightening out of the mortgage tangle and the mounting tax arrears which apparently necessitated a complete liquidation of the equity of the mortgage certificate holders.\n",
