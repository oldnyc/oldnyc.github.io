    "original_title": "Manhattan: West End Avenue - 81st Street (West)",
    "text": "West End Avenue, at, adjoining and south of the S. W. corner of West 81st Street (right), showing four of the five frame shacks at this location. These bore No's 339 to 331 inclusive. To the right is the brick wall of 306 West 81st Street, a structure erected subsequent to 1891 and replacing a frame building. Bromleys Atlas of that year shows the last of the West End shacks; their edition, 1897, disclosing the Avenue frontage cleared.\n\nVarious authorities have located this view as being the N. E. corner of Fifth Avenue and 81st Street. The New York Post of October 1932 published same in their gravure section. The Collection of J. Clarence Davies at the Museum of the City of New York has a copy. The Fifth Avenue Bank during its Centennial week exhibited a copy from the Robert Friedenberg Collection.\n\nBrown Brothers, photographers, whose imprint appears on the back of this, gave the location as Amsterdam Avenue and 81st Street.\n\nThe original is by H. N. Tiemann (stamp at bottom) and whose successors operate a photographic establishment at No. 176 Lexington Avenue. He is credited by the New York Sun in their series of \"Old New York Pictures,\" of which this is No. 50, appearing on November 15, 1928. The location given there is accurate. The writer verified same with the records at their place of business.\n\nH. N. Tiemann, Photo\nBrown Brothers\n\n1894\n",
