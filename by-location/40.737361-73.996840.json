It was rebuilt in 1871 as the Lyceum. Subsequently it was the 14th Street and the Civic Repertory (1926).  It was demolished in 1939.\n\nThe Ninth Regiment can be traced back to 1812.  In 1848 it was re-organized, as an Irish regiment, and disbanded a few years later.  In 1859 it was again reformed.  In 1861, the entire command went to Washington, independently, and was sworn into the United States service for three years.  They formed the 83rd New York Volunteers, seeing service in the Wilderness, at Antietam, Fredericksburg, the second Bull Run, and Gettysburg.  Between 1870 and 1872 James Fisk was the colonel of the Ninth.  The armory was built by the City in 1893 at a cost of $300,000, plus land at $422,000.\n\n1: April 1906\n2: June 23, 1937\n\nView 1: George L. Balgue, photo\nView 2: W. P.

The vacant plot at the left was the site of the former Civic Repertory Theatre and upon which will rise a modern neighborhood motion-picture house.\n\nThis building was opened in 1866 as the Theatre Francaise [sic], and during the first year Jacob Grau presented Ristori there in her American premiere. The house was rebuilt in 1871 and renamed the Lyceum. As time passed, the type of productions changed , tho at one time it was a center of the social and dramatic life.\n\nIt became the 14th Street Theatre later and since 1926, the Civic Repertory Theatre.
