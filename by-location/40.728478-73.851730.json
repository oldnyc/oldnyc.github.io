In 1873, G. and H. Jackson owned the surrounding land and buildings. A.V.S. Lott was the owner from 1891 to some date subsequent to 1909. The real estate atlas of Queens county shows the buildings to be still standing in 1927. The building at the left of the farmhouse, partially seen beyond the hummock, was erected subsequent to 1891. View No. 1 shows an area of ground, viewing eastward from about 102nd Street and 65th Rd., between 66th Avenue and 67th Rd. View No. 2 is also viewed eastward from 66th Road and Queens Blvd. showing a pond in the foreground and the farmhouse and outbuildings beyond. View No. 3 views northeast from 67 Rd. and 102nd Street.
