    "text": "68-76 Washington Square South, from West Broadway to Wooster Street at the S.E. corner of the Square, inclusive.\nOriginally Washington Square South (West 4th Street) was one long block from Thompson to Wooster Streets; but early in the 1870's the old Laurens Street, which ended at Amity Street (West 3rd), was widened, renamed South Fifth Avenue, and cut through to Washington Square. Later it took the present name of West Broadway, the street below Canal Street with which it happened to coincide.\nOur Lady of Mercy Chapel (Roman Catholic) is at 70 Washington Square. 71 Washington Square is a new apartment building erected about 1927 on the site of old 71 and 72, 4-story houses. The garage adjoining it was built around 1913.\nThe building on the S.E. corner of Wooster and 4th Streets, with the flag flying, is a loft building erected around 1895. Since 1925 it has been taken over by New York University.\nMay 24, 1933.\n\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
