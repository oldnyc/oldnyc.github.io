    "text": "West End Avenue at 72nd Street, looking across at the S.W. corner from the excavation on the N.W. corner, where the new Hudson Towers apartment building is to be erected. It replaces the original buildings on the site, which were erected about 1890. The old residences across the avenue on the S.W. corner are about to be demolished to make room for a fifteen story apartment building. The building to the right of the picture, adjoining the excavation, is 303 West 72nd Street, erected between 1910 and 1916. Early 1924.\n\nGift of E. M. Jenks.",
