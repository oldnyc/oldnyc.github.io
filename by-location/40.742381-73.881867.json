    "text": "Broadway, west side, opposite Vietor Avenue. In view one the street in the foreground is Laurel Hill Boulevard. At the right background is Broadway, the site of the house and surrounding land was owned by the Rev. John Moore who died in 1657. His son Samuel purchased the tract in 1662. His son Benjamin was followed by Lieutenant Samuel who was a son of Benjamin. He died in 1788. A part of this house was built by him. John a brother of Lieut. Samuel was the next owner. He died in 1827. The center structure dates probably back to 1666 and was the original house of Samuel Moore son of the Rev. John Moore. The house was enlarged in 1760 probably by Lieut. Samuel Moore. It is also questionably stated to be the headquarters of General Howe during the Revolution.
