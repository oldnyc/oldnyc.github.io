It was originally planned to have Thirteenth Avenue continue north of 30th Street and west of Twelfth Avenue, on land to be made by filling along the shore but this plan was never carried out. For practical purposes, Thirteenth Avenue is a souther extension of Twelfth, but slightly towards the east instead of being parallel to Eleventh. May 30, 1934. P. L. Sperr.",
