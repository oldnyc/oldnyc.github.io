    "text": "136-124 East 19th Street, from the center of the block west to the S.E. corner of Irving Place. 132 East 19th Street is a new 7-story basement house with a north light studio; it was built since 1910. The 7-story building on the corner of Irving Place was erected around 1900.\nIn the 1930's this block will have changed little except by remodelling. 138-6 and 134 will lose their stoops, and the former front doors will become windows. The same thing will happen to 130; and the garage at 128 will be made over into a dwelling. The white balls will have been taken off the gateposts of the new house, No. 132; and No. 126, adjoining the little one-story studio, will have lost its portico.\n\nAbout 1912.\n\nGift of E. M. Jenks.\n",
