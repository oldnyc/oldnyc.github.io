The apartment building on the N.W. corner of 94th Street is \"the Towers\"; the two in the middle of the block are \"Fillmore\" and \"Flavia\"; they date from the 1890's. The only buildings visible in the next block are the old house on the N.W. corner of 95th Street and the little chapel adjoining it at 3 West 95th Street.\nMay 31, 1928.\n\nP. L.

All the buildings on Central Park West from 94th to 95th Streets have been de-molished, and a 16-story apartment building is under construction in their place. A new 16-story apartment building is under construction at 3 West 95th Street, and another on the S.W. corner of 96th Street, where the Scotch Presbyterian Church stood.
