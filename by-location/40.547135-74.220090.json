    "text": "Bloomingdale Road, west side, between Tarbes and Wirt Avenues, showing an old house, about 175 feet back of the Road. This old dwelling was at one time (1874 map) on the S. Church estate. Later it was owned by E. V. S. Parnell (1898 map) and by Dumpson (1907-1917 maps). The dirt road, shown here, appears on the maps from 1898 to 1917, but does not bear any name. It runs parallel to Bloomingdale Road, in a south-north direction, and is about 175 feet west of it. The view here is in a southerly direction from a point about 250 yards south of Arthur Kill Road and west of Bloomingdale Road. The New York City zoning map of 1937 does not show any thoroughfare where this dirt road is, so that the best description of its present-day location is that given at the beginning of this paragraph.\n\nJune 1, 1930\n\nP. L. Sperr\n",
