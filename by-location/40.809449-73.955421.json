This last feature is of recent occurance and will be extended to include the Rockefeller-owned tenements on 124th Street, of which the rears appear. An account to this effect was carried in The New York Times of October 5, 1938. To the west is the Lincoln School of Teachers College--the name does not appear in this view. Note St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church facing on Roosevelt Square and occupying a site at the NW corner of this avenue and West 125th Street.\n\nMarch 19, 1938\n\nP.L. Sperr",
