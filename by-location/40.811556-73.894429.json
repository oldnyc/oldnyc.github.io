    "text": "Dupont Street, south (about 100 yards) of the S.W. corner of Leggett Ave., showing the Casanova Mansion (also known as the Whitlock Mansion). It was built in 1859 and was, in its day, one of the most magnificent private residences in the United States. The mansion bears its name from Innocencio Casanova, a Cuban who bought the house after the death of  Benjamin Whitlock. The ediface was razed between 1900 and 1911 (G.W. Bromley maps) and its site is still unoccupied (1932) even though the surrounding area has become a factory district. For Additional data see The Story of the Bronx by Jenkins, page 388.\n\nGift of Randall Comfort.",
