(I.R.T.) subway, after the demolition of houses which formerly stood there. Lafayette Street was created as a result of the joining together of Lafayette Place, which terminated at Great Jones Street, with Elm Street, which commenced at a point slightly south of Jersey Street. This necessitated the razing of many buildings which occupied the area between the above mentioned two streets. The new thoroughfare was given its present name several years later.\nDecember 1900.\nBoard of Transportation Photograph.\nWilliam B. Parsons Collection.\n",
