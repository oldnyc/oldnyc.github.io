This structure, bearing Nos. 1-3 Third Ave. and 59-61 Cooper Square, housed this institution from 1867 to 1935. It was constructed for them two years after it took that name; being formerly known as the Mariners Savings Institution which was organized in 1852. According to the New York Times of December 8, 1937, this, one of the oldest fireproof business buildings in the City, has been sold to the First Ukrainian Evangelical Pentecostal Church Inc., and will be used by them for religious purposes.\nFebruary 5, 1938\nGeorge D.
