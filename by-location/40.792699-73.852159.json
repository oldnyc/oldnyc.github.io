In the foreground is the area south of the Point and the Knickerbocker Yacht Club dock, at the foot of Third Street, later 112th Street. View 2 shows the steamboat Isabel, docked at the Point of View Pier at Tallmans Island, also known as Point of View Island. This island was separated from the mainland by Morris Creek, named after Morris, the island's owner in 1873. Subsequently it was owned by Charles Julius Freygang and after him by Joseph Wetzel, who took over the property in 1892.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection\n1897\nViews 1,2\n",
