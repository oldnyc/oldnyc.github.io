At the time of this picture Sullivan Street had only recently been cut through the block from West Third Street, thus causing the demolition for 48-49 Washington Square. 49 Washington Square had been the Westmore Home for Fallen and Friendless Girls (established 1881).\n\nNotice the old horse-car track alongside the more modern electric track.\n\nSeptember 8, 1905.\n\nBrown Brothers, Photographers.",
